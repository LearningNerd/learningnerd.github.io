title: "Weekly Self-Therapy Vlog Experiment"
---

When I started my experiment to create [100 daily video blogs in 100 days](/vlog/), I didn't know what I was getting into! This was *not* the plan, but many of the videos turned into a sort of self-guided therapy session. I found myself talking about some of my deepest fears and most personal insecurities, and the project helped me build up the courage and self-acceptance I needed to begin tackling some of my lifelong challenges (like anxiety).

I found it so helpful, I want to keep going! While my main goal is to make more creative and educational videos (I don't fancy myself a "vlogger"), I do think I could benefit from continuing what I started. So every week, I make an appointment with myself to reflect on my challenges, review my progress, and make incremental improvements to my life.
