This word always reminds me of that line from <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>: "I'm disinclined to acquiesce your request." <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acquiesce"><em>Acquiesce</em></a> is a fancy, French-derived word that simply means to agree.

More specifically, though, it means to agree passively, to "submit or comply silently or without protest". That's because, according to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=acquiesce">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, it comes from Latin "<em>acquiescere</em> 'remain at rest,' thus 'be satisfied with,' from <em>ad-</em> 'to' + <em>quiescere</em> 'to become quiet'".

So, <em>acquiesce</em> is more than just a fancy word for "agree"; it's a specific word used to describe <em>quiet</em> agreement. If you haven't expressed disagreement, you've acquiesced.
