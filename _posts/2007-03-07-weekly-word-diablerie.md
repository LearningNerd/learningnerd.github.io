<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/diablerie">Diablerie</a></em> is a noun that comes from the French word for devil, and it has several meanings:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>diabolic magic or art; sorcery; witchcraft.</li>

	<li>the domain or realm of devils.</li>

	<li>the lore of devils; demonology.</li>

	<li>reckless mischief; deviltry.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Sounds evil. I like it. :twisted: On a bit of a tangent, there's apparently a bunch of French antique stereoviews called <a href="http://users.telenet.be/thomasweynants/diableries.html">Diableries</a>, which depict skeletons and other diablerie-type stuff.
