title: "Facing a wall of questions (Math Immersion Month Day 7)"
category: Math

Today I gathered up my math questions and stuck them on my living room wall -- now dubbed the Wall of Questions! I wrote a bit about the idea on my blog post for [day 1]({% post_url 2015-12-01-math-day-1 %}).

## Wall of Questions
I'm not worried about answering these questions just yet. (Besides, I've already half-answered a few of them). The point is just to keep track of them (and decorate the walls of my livingroom). Questions written down so far:
