To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conflate">conflate</a></em> is "to bring together; meld or fuse".

It comes from Latin <em>conflare</em>, meaning "to blow together". I imagine it might be somehow related to glassblowing, but that could just be a coincidence.

Either way, <em>conflate</em> is definitely a useful word. I found many examples on Google News where the journalists use <em>conflate</em> to explain how two ideas can become associated with each other so strongly that people can't seem to separate them. For example, people might "conflate masculinity with guns", "conflate Iraq with 9/11", or "conflate marketing with oppression".
