Of course, <em>pugnacious</em> has nothing to do with pugs -- they're too sweet! The word comes from Latin <em>pugnus</em>, meaning "fist". Several other English words also developed from that Latin root, including <em>repugnant</em>, <em>impugn</em>, and <em>pugilist</em>. See the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=pugnacious" title="Words related to pugnacious">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> for more info about all those words.

I'm surprised I've never seen a pun on <em>pug</em> and one of those words before. If I ever get a pug, I'm totally naming him Pugnacious! I also want to have a dog with the name of another breed, like a bulldog named Poodle or a chihuahua named Great Dane. Or a celebrity name, like Elizabeth Taylor. :P
