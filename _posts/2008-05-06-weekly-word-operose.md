<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/operose">Operose</a></em> is an adjective that means "industrious, as a person" or "done with or involving much labor".

It's related to the words <em>operate</em>, <em>operation</em>, and even <em>opera</em>. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=operation">operation</a></em> comes from the Latin word <em>operari</em>, meaning "to work", which is related to the Latin word <em>opus</em>, meaning "a work".

The word <em>opus</em> was taken directly from Latin and thrown into English, and now it's usually used to refer to a musical composition. The word <em>opera</em> is the plural form of <em>opus</em>. I'm not sure how those words developed their specific meanings over the years, but it was cool to find out how they're related! Or at least that's <em>my</em> idea of an exciting evening.
