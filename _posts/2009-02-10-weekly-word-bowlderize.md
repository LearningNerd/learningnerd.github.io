To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bowdlerize">bowlderize</a></em> means "to remove material that is considered offensive or objectionable" from a book or other written work.

The word comes from the man <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bowdler">Thomas Bowdler</a>, an "English editor who in 1818 published a notorious expurgated Shakespeare, 'in which those words and expressions are omitted which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family'" (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bowdlerize" title="Online Etymology Dictionary - Bowlderize">OED</a>). Shakespeare had to be censored? I bet Bowlder is turning over in his grave right now, what with modern entertainment and all.
