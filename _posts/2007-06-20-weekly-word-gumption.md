<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gumption">Gumption</a></em> is an informal noun that means "initiative", "aggressiveness", "resourcefulness", "courage", "common sense", and "shrewdness". In other words, it's a good quality to have.

The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gumption">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> says this on the word's history:

<blockquote>
1719, Scottish, "common sense, shrewdness," also "drive, initiative," possibly connected with M.E. <em>gome</em> "attention, heed," from O.N. <em>gaumr</em> "heed." Originally "common sense, shrewdness," sense of "initiative" is first recorded 1812.
</blockquote>

I found some usage examples on Google News, such as "the gumption to start businesses", "a gal with too much gumption", and "Forest Gumption".
