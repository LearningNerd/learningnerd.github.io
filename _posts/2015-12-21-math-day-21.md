Aside from getting up to 6th grade math on Khan Academy and doing non-math work, I reflected on a strange reaction I had to Christmas trees while walking around the city. Wow, I *really* miss my mom today and it hurts. But I'm glad I can still smile about the good memories I have of her, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to do what I know would make her proud.
