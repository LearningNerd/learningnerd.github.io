The verb <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/thraw">to thraw</a></em> means "to throw" in British dialect, and in Scottish it means "to twist" or "to oppose". The adjective <em>thrawn</em> can mean "twisted; crooked" or "perverse; contrary". I discovered this word through a post by my internet buddy Kiri, who wrote about some of the <a href="http://www.wkiri.com/today/?p=62">words used in Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a>.

Apparently <em>thraw</em> comes from <em>throw</em>, and the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=throw" title="Throw">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> reveals that <em>throw</em> evolved from a root word that meant "to turn", possibly because of "the notion of whirling a missile before throwing it."

That may explain the history of the word <em>throw</em>, but I couldn't find anything on how <em>throw</em> turned into <em>thraw</em>. Why did <em>thraw</em> retain the old meaning "to twist" or "to turn", even though it came from <em>throw</em> (which already lost that meaning)? Any guesses?
