title: "Solving the Borromean hairpins puzzle (Math Immersion Month Day 13)"

Proof that I did solve the Borromean hairpins puzzle! Today was another busy day, so aside from doing more arithmetic practice, I quickly spliced together some new footage with clips from [my interview with mathematician Henry Segerman]({% post_url 2015-12-11-math-day-11 %}) and [my first time using a 3D printer]({% post_url 2015-12-9-math-day-9 %}):

I like how this one turned out! Storytelling and editing is definitely more fun when I can work with a variety of footage, which is much easier to acquire over the course of several days. I'm *so* ready to stop making daily video blogs now, but I'll stick it out until day 100, which will be in early January. I can't wait to have more time for math again! I also really need a proper weekend after working two weekends in a row now, bleh.
