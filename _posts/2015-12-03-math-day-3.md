title: "My first arithmetic test as an adult! (Math Immersion Month Day 3)"
category: math
---

When's the last time you voluntarily took a math test? Today I did some arithmetic drills for the first time in 10+ years! I also talk about [my favorite book](http://amzn.to/1ldS6SY) and ramble about other mathy stuff (in between complaining about getting sick).

Tomorrow I'll review my test scores and actually do some more studying; I didn't get to finish today because I slept a lot! And then I had too much fun playing with video production stuff. (Today I learned that I don't mind doing lots of video editing when I'm sick and lying in bed.) 

I printed out the arithmetic drills from this [math worksheet generator](http://themathworksheetsite.com/) -- a very nifty tool for customizable, printable PDFs of randomly-generated arithmetic problems. (Or are they only *pseudo-random*? That's a topic for another day!)

In case you want to be really bored, here's the full, unedited footage of me taking the first arithmetic quizzes of my adult life:

## Time breakdown
Today was way out of balance! My original schedule (see [day 2]({% post_url 2015-12-02-math-day-2 %})) was just a guideline of course, but I do want to stay closer to the plan. I obviously can't spend 7 hours on video production every day, and I wish I spent more time actually learning! (Though I did learn a couple new video editing tricks like the picture-in-picture thing, importing new fonts, and it was fun!)

- Video production time: 6 hours 55 min
  - Script writing/preparation: 10 min
  - Filming/setup: 1 hour 30 min
  - Video editing: 4 hours 15 min
  - Publishing: 1 hour *(note: mostly just wasting time playing with Photoshop)*
- Math study time: 1 hour 25 min
  - Practice problems: 1 hour 25 min
  - General research: none
