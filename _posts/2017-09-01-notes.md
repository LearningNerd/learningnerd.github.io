Today was an amazing day, as all Fridays have been lately! I went for an early hike, taught another short afternoon workshop, got the ball rolling on teaching another paid workshop series, did some pair programmingand on that GitHub CMS idea with my friend, and went rock climbing at night!

## Early morning

Today I woke up at 6am and went on a hike with my friends again around the lake in Franklin Canyon. Highlights from today's trip: I saw the sun rise as I drove from my family's house into Westwood, I climbed a tree, and this time I *did not* indulge in Nutella (just a tiny bite of bread). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning! Did you know there&#39;s a lake a short drive from Westwood or Beverly Hills? :) Saw the sun rise today! :) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyDayInLA?src=hash">#MyDayInLA</a> <a href="https://t.co/2yif48eaDz">pic.twitter.com/2yif48eaDz</a></p>&mdash; Liz Krane (@LearningNerd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningNerd/status/903627864393768961">September 1, 2017</a></blockquote>

I also finished going through my notes in ["Creativity, Inc."](http://www.creativityincbook.com/) so I could finally return the book to my friend. Following my new book-processing routine, I just took photos of each page that I had marked a quote or item of interest. I also shared a couple of the quotes on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Getting the right people &amp; the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea&quot;<br><br>Just finished &quot;Creativity, Inc.&quot; Great book! <a href="https://t.co/y8HpquBIfa">pic.twitter.com/y8HpquBIfa</a></p>&mdash; Liz Krane (@LearningNerd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningNerd/status/903651153849626624">September 1, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I also finally got around to fixing a couple more little bugs in my [social alarm clock app prototype](/social-alarm-clock). I really enjoyed today's message!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks so much <a href="https://twitter.com/waynerad">@waynerad</a> for the silly limerick via <a href="https://t.co/uv4V0ihorJ">https://t.co/uv4V0ihorJ</a>! I finally got to read it and had a good laugh! :D</p>&mdash; Liz Krane (@LearningNerd) <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningNerd/status/903658172484788224">September 1, 2017</a></blockquote>

But my app clearly isn't working anymore to actually get me out of bed in the morning. Scheduling activities with friends early in the morning works much better, but it's hard to do it *every single day.* So maybe the social alarm clock app just needs that voice message feature and it may serve as a good backup motivator.


## Workshop notes

  - For today's workshop, I sent a message via the Meetup website to each person who RSVPed to personally ask them if they still plan to attend. Hopefully that will help stabilize the attendance rate a bit!

  - This time I *started* with planning and then introduced JavaSceipt concepts and the browser console examples only after setting up the project and our end goal. I think that worked much better!

  - I also showed the working app at the beginning of the class as a preview of what to expect, and then I erased all the JavaScript but left the HTML.

  - This time I actually remembered to ask for donations before everyone left, so not surprisingly, we got more donations!

  - There was a lot of interest in future paid workshops to make bigger projects together and build on what we learned in that one hour. Next time I should probably give everyone the link to the class signup form!


## Open source Friday

Today my friend and I started on our GitHub CMS idea and made [a repo for it here](https://github.com/LearningNerd/github-cms). I learned about [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) and how it integrates super nicely with GitHub, I relearned [how to register a GitHub app](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/registering-github-apps/) and install it, I saved the private key and formatted it by replacing line breaks in my text editor with an actual `\n` character, and we almost got it working!

Food for thought later: remember to look up that talk "Building a collaborative CMS with GitHub" by David Stolarsky, Software Engineer at the New York Times.
