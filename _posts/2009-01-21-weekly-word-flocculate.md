To <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Jan.20.2009">flocculate</a></em> means "to aggregate or coalesce into small lumps or loose clusters". This word obviously doesn't come up every day. It is used in chemistry, though. From <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Jan.20.2009">Merriam-Webster</a>:

<blockquote>
"In the late 16th century, scientists noticed that the loose masses separated from a solution or suspension through precipitation often resembled tufts of wool..."
</blockquote>

Here's the connection: the Latin word for "tuft of wool" is <em>floccus</em>. The adjective <em>flocculent</em> means "like a tuft of wool", the flocculating process is called flocculation, and the "loose clusters" themselves are called floccules, flocculi, or flocs.

The word <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocculus">flocculus</a></em> can also refer to part of the brain, as well as "any of various cloudlike masses of gases appearing as bright or dark patches on the surface of the sun." I can't wait to work this one into an everyday conversation!
