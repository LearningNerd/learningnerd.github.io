I found <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abecedarian"><em>abecedarian</em></a> the other day from <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/">Dictionary.com's Word of the Day</a>. As a noun, it means "a person who is learning the letters of the alphabet" or "a beginner in any field of learning". As an adjective, it means "of or pertaining to the alphabet", "arranged in alphabetical order", or "rudimentary".

It comes from "Middle English, from Medieval Latin <em>abecedarium</em>, <em>alphabet</em>, from Late Latin <em>abecedarius</em>, <em>alphabetical : from the names of the letters A B C D</em> + <em>-arius</em>, <em>-ary</em>."

Apparently an <em>abecedarian</em> is also a <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5767">type of poem</a> and, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecedarian" title="Abecedarian on Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, "a 16th century German sect of Anabaptists who affected an absolute disdain for all human knowledge". Interesting.
