It's my bedtime, so I guess I'm not going to work on this project today. I could, but then it would be even harder for me to wake up on time tomorrow , and I already have enough trouble with that. I'm hoping I'll have a fresh start tomorrow. I'm going to work on creating a stylesheet from scratch. Come to think of it, I should probably set a specific goal every evening to do the following morning. Why haven't I been doing that already? Ugh, I'm so sleepy. I really hope I can wake up on time tomorrow. But if not, then I'll stay home and work on my project in the evening instead of doing something social. (Socializing is exhausting, anyway.) So, better luck to me for tomorrow! Goodnight.
