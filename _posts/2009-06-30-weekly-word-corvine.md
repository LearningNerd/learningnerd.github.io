I haven't come across any particularly interesting new words lately, so I'm just going to share one of Merriam-Webster's words of the day, <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Jun.23.2009">corvine</a></em>. It's an adjective that means "resembling a crow".

This word comes straight from the Latin word <em>corvus</em>, meaning "raven". Merriam-Webster shares an interesting bit of etymology:

<blockquote>
Another word from "corvus" is "cormorant," which refers to a dark-colored seabird and comes from Old French words meaning "raven" and "of the sea."
</blockquote>

Bonus trivia: Cormorants are known for their voracious appetites, so the word <em>cormorant</em> also means "a greedy person" or "glutton".
