So I _did_ succeed in working for 15 minutes today, before moving to my new apartment. And what did I learn? That 15 minutes really isn&#39;t enough time, lol. I was just looking through [Jennifer Dewalt&#39;s websites](http://jenniferdewalt.com/) again (she made 180 websites in 180 days) and I felt pretty lousy about my [30 Days of Web Dev project](learningnerd.github.io/30DaysOfWebDev/) in comparison... But then I found out that she worked on her project full-time. She had quit her job and planned to focus on learning how to code for a year. No wonder her websites were so much better! Ah, learning new things full-time... that sounds like a dream come true to me. I&#39;ve thought about doing something similar for a long time, but I&#39;m not sure I have the guts to do it. I&#39;ve been thinking about it, though. It&#39;s feasible. It could be amazing. Well, one day at a time for now.

**Goal for tomorrow:** Work for 30 minutes, picking up where I left off on Wednesday. I&#39;m planning to attend my first hackathon tomorrow for [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/), but I should be able to squeeze in a little time in the evening to work on my own stuff before passing out.
