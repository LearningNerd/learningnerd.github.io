<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reification">Reification</a></em> is the "act of materializing". In other words, to <em>reify</em> is "to convert into or regard as a concrete thing". Another more specific definition describes it as "representing a human being as a physical thing deprived of personal qualities or individuality".

Is it just me, or does this sound like a made-up word? I'm used to seeing the prefix <em>re-</em> in words like <em>redo</em> and <em>rediscover</em>. I'm used to seeing the suffix <em>-fication</em> in words like <em>modification</em> and <em>verification</em>. So when I see this strange word <em>reification</em>, I think it's just a prefix and suffix together with no real word in between them! Thankfully, the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=reification" title="Reification">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> shows that the <em>re-</em> in this word is actually from the Latin stem of <em>res</em>, meaning "thing" in Latin. And here's a little did-you-know tidbit: the German word for <em>reification</em>, a la Marxism, is <em>Verdinglichung</em>.

See Wikipedia's page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification">reification</a> for its specific meanings in computer science, linguistics, and yes, Marxism too!
