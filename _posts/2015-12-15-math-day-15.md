I joined my friend John to help tutor people at [The Midnight Mission](http://www.midnightmission.org/) in downtown Los Angeles, my first time tutoring anyone! It was so inspiring to be in a math class where everyone *wanted* to be there. I can't wait to go back -- maybe one day I'll even teach a class! Today I also finished fourth grade math on Khan Academy, woohoo!
