## What I did today

  - Slept in until 8am, giving up on waking up early and missing my early morning virtual pair programming meeting with my friend
  - Washed dishes and put some clothes away
  - Went to the gym, did a brisk uphill walk on the treadmill for a mile, climbed a few rocks, did a few pull-ups
  - Picked up several laptops donated to Women Who Code / Girl Develop It from Ticketmaster
  - Reviewed Women Who Code leader training materials and social media accounts
  - Followed up on some emails for upcoming events I'm planning with Women Who Code and Girl Develop It
  - Did some research on other possible venues for those upcoming events and reached out to one new venue
  - Sent out an email to invite more people to sign up for the workshop series I'm starting in a couple weeks (after I postponed it)
  - Saw "Logan Lucky" with my parents and then went out to dinner together
  - Returned back to my apartment late at night just in time to read a while and then go to sleep
