The word <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/quotidian">quotidian</a></em> means "daily" or "ordinary". It comes from the Latin word <em>quotidianus</em>, meaning "daily".

<em>Quotidian</em> usually has a slightly negative connotation; it's more like <em>mundane</em> than the neutral word <em>daily</em>. But I like it, since it's probably the fanciest word you could use to describe something ordinary! Who doesn't love ironic words? To me, <em>quotidian</em> is the linguistic equivalent of Andy Warhol's "work of art" titled <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A6246&page_number=12&template_id=1&sort_order=1">"Campbell's Soup Cans"</a>.
