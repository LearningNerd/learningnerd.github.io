<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/titivate">Titivate</a></em> means "to make decorative additions to", "to spruce up". The word has been around for a while, but its origin is unknown. It's an alteration of <em>tidivate</em>, possibly a combination of the words <em>tidy</em> and <em>renovate</em> or <em>elevate</em>.

It was featured on <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/titivate.html">A.Word.A.Day</a> for the theme "words that seem risque". Yup, I'll admit it, the word <em>titivate</em> made me giggle! Similar words include&nbsp;<em>titillate</em>, "to tickle" or "to excite, especially in a superficial, pleasurable manner", and <em>titubate</em>, "to stumble".
