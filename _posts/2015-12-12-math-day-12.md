I squeezed in an hour of practice on Khan Academy today, but no time for anything creative. I have a challenge against my online friend [Chris Lucas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TyjbQ9E5no) to see who can get farther in math this month! Aside from that, I'm just busy working on a paid side project and trying to recover from this cold I've been fighting on and off.
