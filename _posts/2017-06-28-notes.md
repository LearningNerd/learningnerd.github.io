**Goal for today:** get the mob coding app working, test it out again at tonight's meetup, and do some more refactoring!

## Real-time notes

**8:41am:** I got here nice and early today, but wow am I sleepy! I'm at two-tea-bag status. I'll take another siesta today, this time earlier. (The last two times I took my siesta after 4pm, I had trouble falling asleep at night and felt super tired the next day. Maybe 1pm or 2pm is a better time.) Anyway, I'm diving right back into refactoring! I'll fix [issue #3](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/mob-coding/issues/3) to remove that unneccesary Boolean and simplify the condition for forking/editing Gists and then update my flowchart accordingly.

**8:57am:** Worked like a charm! I even closed the issue directly from my commit. But I totally forgot that I'd lose any unstaged changes when I merged my `issue3` branch into `master`, oops! I really need to remember to use `git stash` more, or stage my changes at the very least! Oh well. I'll redo my edits to `README.md` and then fix up and publish the new version of my flowchart.

**9:17am:** All fixed up! Much better:

Now I'll just post this in the mob coding README to make it more official. (I guess I'll post the latest version of the flowcharts and stuff in there, and I'll keep the historical record of all the work-in-progress stuff in my blog posts like this one.)
