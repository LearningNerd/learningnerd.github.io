Yesterday, in my first college class, the syllabus had this quote by Annie Dillard: "The writing has changed, in your hands, and in a twinkling, from an expression of your notions to an epistemological tool." Then the professor asked if anyone in the class knew what <em>epistemological</em> means. No hands were raised. I knew it had to mean "relating to epistemology", but I didn't know what that meant either.

So, thanks to college, I learned that <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/epistemology">epistemology</a> is "a branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge". The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epistemology" title="Epistemology">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> says that <em>epistemology</em> comes from the Greek word <em>episteme</em>, meaning "knowledge".

I assume that an "epistemological tool" helps you explore knowledge. I found more obscure epistemological things on <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=epistemological&btnG=Search+News" title="Search for Epistemological on Google News">Google News</a>, like "a cruel epistemological riddle", "epistemological preferences", and "epistemological vertigo".
