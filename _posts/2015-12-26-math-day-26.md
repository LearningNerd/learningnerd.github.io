category: Math

Just a snippet of today's conversation, in which my dad and I read about [Einstein's proof of the Pythagorean theorem](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/einsteins-first-proof-pythagorean-theorem). We understand it now! Eh, sort of. Big thanks to John Baez for suggesting [this article](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/einsteins-first-proof-pythagorean-theorem)!
