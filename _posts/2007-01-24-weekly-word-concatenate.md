While doing some research on <a href="http://programming.learningnerd.com/tag/php/" title="ProgrammingNerd PHP Category">PHP</a>, I came across this strange word several times. What does it mean? How do you pronounce it? Well, to <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/concatenate">concatenate</a></em> is "to link together; unite in a series or chain", and it sounds like <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?concat02.wav=concatenate" title="Merriam-Webster Pronunciation of Concatenate">this</a>.

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=concatenation">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, the word comes from Latin "<em>com-</em> 'together' + <em>catenare</em>, from <em>catena</em> 'a chain.'"

The adjective form is <em>concatenate</em> (sounds like <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?concat01.wav=concatenate" title="Merriam-Webster Pronunciation of Concatenate">this</a>), meaning "linked together, as in a chain." There's also the noun <em>concatenation</em>, the process of concatenating, and the noun <em>concatenator</em>, which I assume is something or someone that concatenates. :roll: This is starting to sound technical!

Well, it does also have a more specific meaning in computer science: "To arrange (strings of characters) into a chained list." If you're curious about this, take a look at Wikipedia's entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation">Concatenation</a>.

Now, I've never heard this word used in normal conversation, but it <em>is</em> used outside of computer science. With a quick search on <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a>, I found examples like "unholy concatenation of low interest rates and high growth in income", "concatenation of falsehoods", "the whole concatenation of events leading to the deal", and "iPhone is a convenient concatenation of the names iPod and phone".

You could easily replace <em>concatenation</em> with <em>combination</em>, but it wouldn't be exactly the same. <em>Concatenation</em> has a more specific meaning -- plus it sounds much more intriguing! It sounds like a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/concoction">concoction</a> of some sort; it's like alchemy, scientific and magical all at the same time. Or at least that's what it sounds like to me. What do you think?
