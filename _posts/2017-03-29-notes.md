Just a few notes from working on my mob coding app:

**Milestones:**

  - Version 0 (branch `v0-shared-editor`): collaborative real-time text-editing now works, yay! Just a simple shared text editor.

**Questions:**

  - What's the difference between the [`input` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input) and something like `keyup`? (Apparently `input` fires only if it changes the input, whereas `keyup` fires for pressing any key, even one that doesn't actually type anything. Not supported in IE < 9.)

  - Is there a nifty library for styling console.log messages? (Or I can just write my own helper function.)

  - How do I commit new changes into a new branch in Git? ([Simple answer via StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1394804))
