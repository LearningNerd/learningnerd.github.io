It's that time of year again -- time for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>! To commemorate my second year of NaNoveling, I found a new literary word: <em>belletristic</em>.

This fancy term comes from the French <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/belles%20lettres">belles lettres</a></em> (literally "beautiful letters"), which means "literature regarded as a fine art". More specifically, it refers to "light and elegant literature, esp. that which is excessively refined, characterized by aestheticism, and minor in subject, substance, or scope".

So the adjective <em>belletristic</em> means "written and regarded for aesthetic value rather than content" -- in other words, the opposite of my NaNoWriMo novel!

I won't care about aesthetics <em>or</em> content. The only thing that matters is word count. I guess the proper term would be <em>beaucoup de lettres</em>, right? ;) Art in its highest form.
