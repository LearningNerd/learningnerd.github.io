<p>Today, I start learning everything. And I'm going to start  with arithmetic, cause, like I said, I'm starting at the very beginning. What I want to do is just start over again and learn math at my own pace, taking time to stop and smell the mathematical roses. And this time, I want to have fun with it! I want to explore and play and see if I can <em>enjoy</em> math for a change. You know, like <a href="http://vihart.com/">Vi Hart</a> does it? Oh, I could marry that girl.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because of school, I always hated math. When I think of math class, I think of memorizing formulas, boring teachers,  and <em>being bored out of my mind</em>.</p>
<p>So, instead, I want to just learn math the way I <em>wish</em>  I could've learned it in the first place. I'm not gonna focus on boring algorithms like how to do long division; no, I want to just focus on the fundamental concepts behind it all. I want to understand this stuff for a change!</p>

<p>And I don't have all it figured out yet, but I do know I want to start out by examining how the brain understands math in the first place, and that's mostly because I have a bunch of really cool books on neuroscience and numerical cognition.</p>
<p>And in addition to that... Get it? <em>In addition?</em> ;) In addition to that, I also want to review all the fundamental operations  like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division... all that basic stuff that you have to know if you're gonna take over the world.</p>

<p>But first, I have so many questions that I need to answer, like what is the difference between the commutative property and the assocative property? What <em>is</em> an irrational number? What is a number? How old are we when we first start to understand humbers? And how many animals can understand numbers? And which came first: the abstract concept of numbers, or the numerals we use to represent those numbers? And why is a negative times a negative equal to a positive? And is  math really invented, or is it discovered?</p>

<p><em>(Attempting to build a house of cards and failing miserably.)</em> I know arithmetic might not be the most exciting thing to start with, but you need to have a solid foundation before... you need to have... a solid... founda-<em>shhhhhi</em> â€” OK, new metaphor. This is what I'm <em>not</em> going to do with the foundation of my mathematical understanding. <em>(Throwing the deck of cards in the air, starting a game of 52 pickup.)</em></p>

<p>Of course, you don't have to be good at arithmetic to do more advanced math. For example, when I took calculus, I had no problem with the calculus part. Limits and derivatives, piece of cake! But when it came down to simple arithmetic... I had a lot of, um,  brain farts, let's call them. Oopsies. I was so slow, I didn't even finish my first college calculus exams, and, um, yeah... That didn't work out too well. But at least I know enough math to know that 55% is a failing grade.</p>

<p>I would love to work my way back up to calculus again, but I want to make sure I do it by understanding <em>why</em> everything works rather than just memorizing <em>how</em> it works. So I have my work cut out for me. But I hope you join me, and learn math with me, and send me all your questions about arithmetic and math in general and I'll see if I can find the answers. There's a good chance they might be right behind me.</p>
