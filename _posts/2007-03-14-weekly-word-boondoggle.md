From <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Mar.12.2007">Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day</a>, I came across the word <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boondoggle">boondoggle</a>. It has a few meanings:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>a product of simple manual skill, as a plaited leather cord for the neck or a knife sheath, made typically by a camper or a scout.</li>
	<li>work of little or no value done merely to keep or look busy.</li>
	<li>a project funded by the federal government out of political favoritism that is of no real value to the community or the nation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

As a verb, it can also be used simply to mean "to deceive".

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boondoggle&searchmode=none">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, <em>boondoggle</em> was "popularized during the New Deal as a contemptuous word for make-work projects for the unemployed".

<a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-boo1.htm" title="World Wide Words - Boondoggle">World Wide Words</a> explains that <em>boondoggle</em> was popularized through a <em>New York Times</em> article titled "$3,187,000 Relief is Spent to Teach Jobless to Play ... Boon Doggles Made".

And the American Heritage Dictionary says the word was coined by an American scoutmaster named Robert H. Link -- whoever that is.
