<em><a href="http://">Feckless</a></em> is a weird adjective that means "ineffective", "futile", "lazy", or "indifferent".

The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=feckless">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> explains that it comes from the Scots word <em>feck</em>, a shortened version of <em>effect</em>, and it was "popularized by Carlyle, who left its opposite, <em>feckful</em>, in dial. obscurity".

The word <em>feck</em> sounds a lot like a common expletive used in English (hint: it also starts with an "f" and ends with a "ck"). Well, according to Wikipedia's page on <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feck">feck</a></em>, it actually is used that way in modern Irish English. It can also mean "to throw", "to steal", and more. Meanwhile, the English word <em>feckless</em> doesn't seem to be nearly as common (or as interesting).
