This is just an unedited self-therapy video blog about fighting anxiety as I work on starting a part-time programming bootcamp. Building off the work I've done with <a href="http://learnteachcode.org/">Learn Teach Code</a>, the meetup group I started in 2015, this will be the most ambitious project I've attempted so far! And I'm excited, but also terrified! So I figured I'd better share the journey.

I'll be [**sharing all my notes and video blogs here**](/learn-teach-code/) as I work on this over the next few weeks!

I'll probably add some more notes here at the end of the day outlining whatever work I got done (aside from filming the video blog).
