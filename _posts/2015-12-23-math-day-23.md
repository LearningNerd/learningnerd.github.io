I'm 70% done with 6th grade math on Khan Academy, but subtraction still drives me crazy! My dad taught me a new subtraction algorithm, which was apparently the most common algorithm taught between 1700 and 1900 -- but more on that later, once I figure out how to get access to the academic journals. ;)
