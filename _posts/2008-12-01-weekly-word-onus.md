The noun <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Nov.22.2008">onus</a></em> means "a disagreeable necessity", an "obligation", "burden", or "blame". From Merriam-Webster:

<blockquote>
English borrowed the word -- spelling, meaning, and all -- from Latin in the 17th century. We can also add that it's a distant relative of the Sanskrit word for "cart" (a vehicle that carries a burden). English isn't exactly loaded with derivatives of Latin "onus," but the root did give us "onerous" ("troublesome") and "exonerate" ("to clear from accusation or blame" -- thus, "to unburden").
</blockquote>

The word also appears in the legal term <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof">onus probandi</a></em>, burden of proof.
