The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gauche">gauche</a></em> means "lacking social grace", "awkward", or "crude". It comes from the French word <em>gauche</em>, meaning "left", which came from a similar but older French word that meant "to trample" or "walk clumsily" (see the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gauche" title="Online Etymology Dictionary - Gauche">OED</a> for more).

Now why would the word for "awkward" be so closely related to the word for "left"? And why does the word "right" also mean "correct"? Clearly, one direction is considered better than the other. Check out Wikipedia's blurb on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handedness#Social_stigma_and_repression_of_left-handedness">social stigma of left-handedness</a> for some more language trivia that at least partially explains the bias.
