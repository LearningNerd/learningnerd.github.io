<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perambulate">Perambulate</a> - <em>v. to walk or travel about; stroll. To traverse in order to examine or inspect.</em>

In England, a <em>perambulator</em> is a baby carriage, also called a <em>pram</em> for short. But the novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paths_of_the_Perambulator"><em>The Paths of the Perambulator</em></a> isn't about a baby carriage; a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perambulator">perambulator</a> can also be "an odometer pushed by a person walking" or "a person who makes a tour of inspection on foot."

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=perambulate">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, <em>perambulate</em> comes from Latin <em>per-</em> "through" and <em>ambulare</em> "to walk".

Yes, <em>perambulate</em> is a fancy word, but somehow it isn't as ridiculous as using <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ambulate"><em>ambulate</em></a> instead of <em>walk</em>.
