To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/occlude">occlude</a></em> is "to close, shut, or stop up". Simple word, simple meaning -- and yet I've never run across it before! Maybe my mind was occluded by other thoughts, so I just never remember seeing it. I do have a tendency to just skip over the words I don't know, because I'm too lazy to look them up. But don't tell anyone that!

Anyway, <em>occlude</em> comes from Latin <em>occludere</em>, a combination of <em>ob</em> "against, up" and <em>claudere</em> "to shut, close", according to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=occlude" title="Occlude - Online Etymology Dictionary">OED</a> (the Online Etymology Dictionary, not the Oxford English Dictionary).

Occluding or <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/occlusion">occlusion</a></em>, the act of occluding, has a number of specific meanings in different fields. In phonetics, for example, it's a "momentary complete closure at some area in the vocal tract, causing stoppage of the flow of air and accumulation of pressure." A coronary occlusion is the "closure or blockage of a blood vessel", and an occluded front is when a cold weather front covers a warm front (or something like that -- I'm not a meteorologist).
