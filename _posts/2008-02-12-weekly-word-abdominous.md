The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abdominous">abdominous</a></em> means "having a large belly" or "potbellied".

This word obviously comes from <em>abdomen</em>, which comes straight from Latin, meaning "belly". The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=abdomen">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> supposes that <em>abdomen</em> might come from <em>abdere</em>, Latin for "to conceal", since it conceals all those guts and whatnot that we'd rather not see.

I thought <em>abdominous</em> was a strange word, because it sounds like a made-up variation of <em>abdominal</em>. But then I found out that the suffix <em>-ous</em> means "possessing" or "full of". So, literally, the word <em>abdominous</em> means "full of belly".
