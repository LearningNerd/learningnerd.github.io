Today I participated in my first hackathon ever! I joined [Hack for LA](http://www.hackforla.org/) for [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/), and here I am (holding up the sign) with some of my awesome team members:

**Today I learned:**

*   How to reduce the size of a [geoJSON](http://geojson.org/) file by simplifying the geometry of a map in [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
*   How to use the [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [ESRI Leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/) geocoding APIs
*   How to parse JSON data using JavaScript and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
*   How to add markers to a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map
*   How to create and switch between multiple branches in [GitHub](http://github.com)
*   How to effectively use GitHub for a real team project

Whew! What a day! After 10 hours at the hackathon, I walked home and spent the whole evening moving more stuff to my new apartment and cleaning. And first thing tomorrow morning, I'm doing it all over again!

I didn't have time to work on my meetup website project today, but at least I did learn about lots of other interesting stuff from a diverse team of map-makers, graphic designers, programmers and writers. I saw lots of my friends there, too! There's no substitute for the experience of building a real thing to solve real problems side-by-side with real people! I hope I can find a way to make similar experiences a regular part of my life. That's why I started the [Learn to Code LA](http://learntocode.com) meetup group, so hopefully I can build on this experience to make better events and share the same excitement with my community.
