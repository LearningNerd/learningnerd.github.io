<p>Hello! My name's Liz and yup, I want to learn everything. And while I'm at it, I'll also be making lots of videos to share what I learn. This 3-minute introduction video explains what this crazy project is and why I'm doing it.</p>

<p>
Hello, there! My name is Liz, and I want to learn... music composition, animation, how to make videos games, engineering, design, the arts, the sciences...
</p>

<h2>Goal #1: Learn Everything</h2>

<p>
Phew! So that's probably enough to keep me busy for several lifetimes or so, but that's only half of my plan. I also want to share everything I learn, and to do that, I'm going to make a video on every new concept I come across, teaching what I learn while I'm learning it. And for every educational video I make, I'm going to pin a little sticky note badge onto my lovely corner office. The plan is to start with the very, very basics and work my way up one step at a time.
</p>

<h2>The Videos</h2>

<p>
First of all, the videos will be short and to the point. I'm aiming for about five minutes or less. And whenever I get the chance, I'm going to make good use of images, video clips, famous quotes, cultural references... whatever I can do to get a point across.
<p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I am not an expert. At anything. Like Albert Einstein said, "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." And to make up for my lack of expertise, I plan to cross-reference all my information from lots of online resources and, of course, books. I want my information to be 100% accurate, and if it's not, I expect you fine people of the internet to tell me. And my videos will have a section of related links and references on my website, so you can see where I got my information and read about the topic in more detail.</p>

<h2>Why Learn Everything?</h2>

<p>
You know the saying, "Knowledge is power." Well, that's one reason to learn everything: world domination! (Bwahahahaha! ;) Tee hee.) But aside from that, the more you understand, the more you can appreciate. So by trying to learn everything, I'll also learn to be <em>interested</em> in everything.
</p>

<h2>Why Make All These Videos?</h2>

<p>Teaching is the best way to learn. Like that popular quote says it, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Plus, sharing what I learn with the whole world is a great way to keep myself motivated. But that part that really makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside is giving back to the amazing community that is the internet.</p>

<p>So, I hope my videos are useful in some way, and I hope you join me and never stop learning new things. But, in return, you have to teach me everything <em>you</em> know. I might need a little help once I get to rocket science.</p>
