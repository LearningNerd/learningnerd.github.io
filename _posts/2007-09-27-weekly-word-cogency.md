My writing teacher has been using the word <em>cogency</em> all the time, and I never bothered to look it up. I've been so busy with school, I haven't had time for anything else!

But anyway, all complaining aside, the word <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cogency">cogency</a></em> means "the quality or state of being convincing or persuasive". The adjective <em>cogent</em> is more common than the noun, and it means "convincing or believable by virtue of forcible, clear, or incisive presentation". So far, I don't think my college essays have been particularly cogent. If only I looked up the word sooner...

The Latin root of <em>cogent</em> is "<em>cogere</em> 'to curdle, to compel, to collect,' from <em>com-</em> 'together' + <em>agere</em> 'to drive'", according to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cogent" title="Cogent">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>. That Latin word also led to the English words <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=coagulate">coagulate</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cache">cache</a></em> and, strangely enough, <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=squat">squat</a></em>.
