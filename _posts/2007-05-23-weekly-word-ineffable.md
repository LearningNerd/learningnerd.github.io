<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ineffable">Ineffable</a></em> is an adjective that means "incapable of being expressed or described in words". Something can also be <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/effable">effable</a></em>, the opposite of <em>ineffable</em>, but for some reason the word <em>effable</em> never seems to show up anywhere.

The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ineffable">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> doesn't have an entry for <em>effable</em>, but <em>ineffable</em> can be traced back to Latin "<em>in-</em> 'not' + <em>effabilis</em> 'speakable,' from <em>effari</em> 'utter,' from <em>ex-</em> 'out' + <em>fari</em> 'speak'".

Wikipedia's page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineffability">Ineffability</a> has an incomplete list of ineffable things -- and some interesting trivia. I liked this quote by Douglas Adams: "We shall grapple with the ineffable, and see if we may not eff it after all."
