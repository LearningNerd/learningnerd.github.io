This is the first new word I've found in a while that I'd actually use regularly. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/malinger"><em>Malinger</em></a>: "To feign illness or other incapacity in order to avoid duty or work."

I can be quite the malingerer. ;) And yes, <em>malingerer</em> really is the noun form of <em>malinger</em>. This word just keeps getting better and better!

It comes from the French word <em>malingrer</em> "to suffer", and the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=malinger">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> says that the meaning "to feign illness to avoid work" may come from the "notion of beggars with sham sores."
