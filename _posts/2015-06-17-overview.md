The slow and steady pace continues as I follow more basic tutorials on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, taking *lots* of breaks to rest my eyes. (This is the third week I've had headaches or eye strain or whatever it is, so I'm pretty frustrated at this point. Hopefully when I get my new glasses next week, I'll have some relief!

Today I'm learning about [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), the most popular JavaScript library. I had avoided it until now because I wanted to make sure I had a good grasp of plain JavaScript first. You see tons of [anonymous functions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Anonymous_Functions) in jQuery, so now that I know what those are, I figure I'm probably ready.

By the way, I think it's especially weird (and cool!) that you can define and run an anonymous function at the same time, like this:

{% highlight js %}
( function() {
	   alert("This works!");
    }
)();
{% endhighlight %}

So yeah, the syntax is quirky, but it's not difficult to learn. The difficult thing about jQuery and JavaScript is the adjustment to [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming), where pieces of your code run when a button is clicked or some other event occurs. It seems simple at first, but it can be really hard to wrap your mind around a complex program that doesn't run sequentially! (I had some headaches with this when I learned Java in the context of Android app development, so at least I sort of know what to expect.)

Anyway, today I'm taking it easy and just following along with a [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) tutorial to get an easy introduction to jQuery's syntax. 

**Today I learned:**

- The [`.ready()` method](https://api.jquery.com/ready/), which doesn't execute code until the page is ready for JavaScript to manipulate its elements
- A bunch of [jQuery's effects](http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/), like [`.fadeOut()`](http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/) and [`.slideUp()`](http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/)
- A bunch of [jQuery's DOM manipulation methods](http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/), like [`.append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/) and [`addClass()`](https://api.jquery.com/addclass/)
- Some of [jQuery's event methods](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/), like [`.click()`](https://api.jquery.com/click/)
- At first I was scared of jQuery's weird dollar sign syntax -- it looks like some sort of PHP black magic! -- but it turns out that `$` is a valid variable name in JavaScript, and jQuery uses it as the shorthand name for the `jQuery()` function! (Recommended reading: [The Mystery of the jQuery Object](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/29/mystery-jquery-object-syntax-basic-introduction/))
- Thanks to a very smart friend of mine, I'm now starting to understand what [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) are!

**Questions:**

- Is there any difference between using jQuery's [`.ready()` method](https://api.jquery.com/ready/) (as in `$(document).ready(  )`) and simply including the JavaScript file at the end of the HTML document?
