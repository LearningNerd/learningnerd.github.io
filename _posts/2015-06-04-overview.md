Today I didn't learn anything in my free time, because I'm moving to a new apartment tomorrow. Of course that's not _really_ a valid excuse, because I could have still made time for at least 15 minutes of work on this in the evening, but I just didn't. I'm not even entirely sure why. :(

**Goal for tomorrow:** Spend at least 15 minutes picking up where I left off yesterday! I can always spare an extra 15 minutes.
