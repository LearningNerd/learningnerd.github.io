A <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tempest">tempest</a></em> is "a violent windstorm" or "a violent commotion, disturbance, or tumult." So, <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tempestuous">tempestuous</a></em> is an adjective meaning "characterized by or subject to tempests" or "resembling a tempest".

The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tempest">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> says that <em>tempest</em> comes from Latin "<em>tempestas</em>  (gen. <em>tempestatis</em>) 'storm, weather, season,' also 'commotion, disturbance,' related to <em>tempus</em> 'time, season.'"

I did a search for <em>tempestuous</em> on <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and found many usage examples like "tempestuous teenager", "the tempestuous situation in the Middle East", "the tempestuous struggle for power in early Rome", "tempestuous girlfriend", and of course "tempestuous weather". Journalists sure love this word!
