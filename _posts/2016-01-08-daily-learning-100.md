This is it! A quick vlog to reflect on what I learned from making 100 videos in 100 days. Thanks to everyone who shared this crazy journey with me, because our covnersations are what made this all worthwhile! As for what's next... I'll still make 3 videos next week and I hope to gradually transition away from thrown-together vlogs and towards more polished videos again. For right now, though, I just can't wait to experience a day without doing any filming or video editing -- I forgot what that feels like!

**Highlight of the day:** I filmed this shortly before leaving to go give a talk and workshop at a high school program for girls interested in computer science, which also went well! My favorite part of that adventure was geeking out with their teacher and one of the other mentors -- two amazing women with engineering backgrounds! Afterwards I had dinner with two of the mentors who both work at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and I had a blast learning more about their jobs and just exchanging funny stories. Hurray for cool new friends!
