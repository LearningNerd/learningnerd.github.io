Today I spent most of the day coworking and collaborating with a couple friends from [Hack for LA](http://www.hackforla.org/), the Los Angeles chapter of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/). They're all about creating collaborations between technologists and local governments to solve community issues, increase civic engagement, and all that good stuff! I've been contributing to an open-source project called [Food Oasis LA](https://foodoasis.la/), a  mobile-friendly website for collecting and mapping the best places to find affordable or free healthy food in Los Angeles -- everything from farmers markets to food pantries to community gardens.

**Today's highlight:** We pushed a new feature to the live site: a form to let anyone suggest new healthy food locations, using GitHub's API to create pull requests!

## Today I Learned

  - Using the `<form>` element adds some nice features for accessibility, like jumping from one form field to the next by pressing a button on mobile devices!

  - You can listen for the [submit event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/submit_(event)) with JavaScript, which fires whenever a form is submitted (as opposed to listening for the "click" event on a button inside the form). Then you can just use [`event.preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) to stop the page from refreshing (if you're using an AJAX call instead, for example). Here's an example CodePen to demonstrate: [https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jmgQgm](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jmgQgm)

  - A quick way to check if a JavaScript library has been loaded is simply to do something like `if (typeof googlemaps === object)`, as in [this example on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35464236) -- it only works if the library is adding something as a global variable, of course.

  - I finally tried out interactive rebasing in Git to squash commits, which I first learned about earlier this year from [Dirk Janssen's "Git Squash" talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ume7xy_7Pd62HA8sdiJsTreNcRaMIntvC2c8wqEcHwY/) at Pivotal Labs for our Learn Teach Code show-and-tell meetup that I organized for our group's 2-year anniversary. It all comes full circle! I had fun introducing that technique to my friends and getting a bit lost together -- we had to relearn how to edit the commit messages in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), and honestly, I might have never had the guts to try it if I was by myself. (Funny how the tiniest things can be intimidating if they involve Vim, haha.) But it worked like a charm!

  - I learned a bit about the [MapBox Geocoding API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#geocoding), which we're using for Food Oasis, and I showed my friend how to test it out with [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/).

## Miscellaneous Cool Stuff

  - [Add SSL to your site for free](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/add-ssl-to-your-site-free/) - This was on my to-do list for a while, and I just found a blog post that looks like a good overview of the current free options!
  - [Josh Branchaud's "Today I Learned" project](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and a Jekyll-based [Today I Learned collection by Chuck Grimmett](http://www.cagrimmett.com/category/TIL/) - Inspiration for my own daily learning notes and how to organize them on my Jekyll blog.
  - ["Biisuke Ball's Big Adventure"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trDnp3dWlXk) - Video clip from a Japanese kids' show that combines a narrative with a very cool Rube Goldberg machine (something I had never seen before)!
  - [Learn Git Branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Remembered about this nice interactive tutorial that I've been meaning to try out again.
