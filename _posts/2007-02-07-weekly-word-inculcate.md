To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inculcate">inculcate</a></em> means "to implant by repeated statement or admonition; teach persistently and earnestly" or "to cause or influence (someone) to accept an idea or feeling".

From the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=inculcate&searchmode=none">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, it comes from Latin "<em>in-</em> 'in' + <em>calcare</em> 'to tread, press in,' from <em>calx</em> 'heel.'"

Makes perfect sense. The way some teachers are, it really feels like they're trying to dig their heel into your brain.
