title: "Math books in bed, more practice, and a little code (Math Immersion Month Day 5)"
category: Math
---

I modified a little web app to compare two addition algorithms, I read some math books, and I finished 2nd grad math on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), all while lying in bed feeling sick all day! My cold is getting worse, but my arithmetic is getting better. ;)

Yesterday [Adam Liss](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AdamLiss) wrote a comment pointing out that "5 + 7" is difficult for everyone and that it's much easier if you break it down into "5 + 5 + 2" -- *why didn't I think of that?!* Haha, thanks Adam!

Inspired by that, I took this [web app by Sarah Fisk](http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/NPQzdW) and modified it to test if Adam's suggestion would indeed speed up my mental addition.

**The results:**

- **"5 + 7" version [(demo and code)](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mVdzpm?editors=001)** -- Questions answered in 1 minute: 39, 41, 44
- **"2 + 5 + 5" version [(demo and code)](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mVdzpm?editors=001)** -- Questions answered in 1 minute: 45, 47, 51

Looks like Adam's suggestion is measurably faster! I did notice one caveat, though: I should've switched up the order to make it more random. Maybe I'll make version 2 tomorrow -- or you can fork it and make your own! Let me know if you do.
