Today I experimented to see what a self-therapy video blog might look like. And I may also post the unedited version here once I have time to upload it. I also started a personal changelog (see below) to track my efforts to reprogram my brain and conquer anxiety and my other most personal obstacles.

## Brain Changelog

### Version 0.0.1
#### Added
- This CHANGELOG (inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)), to track the project of reprogramming Liz's brain and to serve as a fun example of the confluence between software development (especially open source) and [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy). (Not sure how well I can follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), though.)
- New habit: weekly self-therapy vlog.
- New rule: schedule shared activities with my family prior to visiting them.
- New rule: schedule something fun or social for the day after my planned family visit.
