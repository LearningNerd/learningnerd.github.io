I discovered this word while searching for an example sentence for <em><a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-otiose">otiose</a></em> last week: "I will not be drawn into the miasma of premature analysis and debate, an otiose exercise" (<a href="http://www.thenorthwestern.com/article/20090510/OSH06/905100412" rel="nofollow">David Hayford</a>). The noun <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/miasma">miasma</a></em> has a couple definitions:

<ol>
	<li>"A dangerous, foreboding, or deathlike influence or atmosphere"</li>
	<li>"A poisonous atmosphere formerly thought to rise from swamps and putrid matter and cause disease"</li>
	<li>"A thick vaporous atmosphere or emanation"</li>
</ol>

The example sentence I found last week makes good use of <em>miasma's</em> first definition, which appears to be the most common usage now that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory_of_disease">miasma theory of disease</a> has proven false.
