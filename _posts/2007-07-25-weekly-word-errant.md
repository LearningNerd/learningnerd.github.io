<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/errant">Errant</a></em> is an adjective that means "deviating from the regular or proper course", "roving, especially in search of adventure", or "aimless".

From the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=errant">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>:

<blockquote>
1335, from Anglo-Fr. <em>erraunt</em>, from two O.Fr. words that were confused even before they reached Eng.: 1. O.Fr. <em>errant</em>, prp. of <em>errer</em> "to travel or wander," from L.L. <em>iterare</em>, from L. <em>iter</em> "journey, way," from root of <em>ire</em> "to go" (see <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ion">ion</a>); 2. O.Fr. <em>errant</em>, pp. of <em>errer</em> (see <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=err">err</a>). Much of the sense of the latter has gone with Eng. <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arrant">arrant</a> (q.v.).
</blockquote>

Looking at usage examples, I see people writing about errant winds, errant knights, errant cattle, errant teenagers... I'd say <em>errant</em> is a pretty easy word to fit into daily conversation.
