A clause is essentially a <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/06/english-grammar-types-of-phrases/" title="Types of Phrases">phrase</a>, but with both a subject and predicate (more on those in the next post). Clauses are either dependent or independent. An <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause">independent clause</a> can exist by itself as a complete sentence (as in "<em>I love grammar.</em>"), while a dependent clause cannot.
<h2>Dependent or Subordinate Clauses</h2>
A dependent or subordinate clause depends on an independent clause to express its full meaning (as in "<em>Because I love grammar</em>."). These clauses begin with a dependent word, like a <a target="_blank" href="http://grammar.uoregon.edu/conjunctions/subordinating.html">subordinating conjunction</a> or a <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/08/29/english-parts-of-speech-nouns-and-pronouns/#types" title="Nouns and Pronouns - Other Types of Pronouns">relative pronoun</a>.

Dependent clauses can function as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs:

A noun clause can replace any <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/08/29/english-parts-of-speech-nouns-and-pronouns/" title="Nouns and Pronouns">noun</a> in a sentence, functioning as a subject, object, or complement (see <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/10/english-grammar-basic-sentence-elements/">English Grammar: Basic Sentence Elements</a>).</li>

Which song? The <em>new </em>song, the <em>good </em>song, the song <em>that you told me about</em>. Often called relative clauses, they're either restrictive or nonrestrictive (also called defining and non-defining, essential and nonessential, or integrated and supplementary):

	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/CWS/wWORKSHOP/writer_resources/grammar_handbook/restrictive_non_clauses.htm#restrictive" title="Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clauses - Restrictive Clause"><strong>Restrictive Clause</strong></a> - "The building <em>that they built in San Francisco</em> sold for a lot of money." A restrictive clause begins with a relative pronoun like <em>that</em> or <em>who</em> (or sometimes <em>which </em>-- see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/which.htm">Which Versus That</a>)<em>.</em> It specifies or restricts the noun; in this case, it specifies which building the speaker is referring to. Note: the relative pronoun is often omitted ("The building (that) they built"), leaving what is called an elliptical clause or contact clause.</li>

A nonrestrictive clause begins with a relative pronoun like <em>which</em> or <em>who.</em> It adds extra information about an already-specific noun; in this case, there's only one building to talk about, whereas the example for the restrictive clause implies that there could be several buildings.</li>

Like all <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/02/english-parts-of-speech-adjectives-determiners-and-adverbs/#adverbials" title="Adjectives, Determiners, and Adverbs - Adverbials">adverbials</a>, adverb clauses express when, where, why, and how something occurs. A dependent clause is an adverb clause if you can replace it with an <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/02/english-parts-of-speech-adjectives-determiners-and-adverbs/#adverbs" title="Adjectives, Determiners, and Adverbs - Adverbs">adverb</a>, as in "I'll do the laundry <em>later</em>."</li>

Note: <a target="_blank" href="http://community-2.webtv.net/solis-boo/Grammar3/page7.html" title="Armchair Grammarian - Appositives">appositives</a> can include clauses, but I've yet to find a source mentioning an "appositive clause." They're generally regarded as a type of <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/06/english-grammar-types-of-phrases/" title="Types of Phrases">noun phrase</a>, even though they can be restrictive or nonrestrictive like relative clauses.
