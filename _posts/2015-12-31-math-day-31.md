Happy New Year! I did some late-night (or early morning?) reflection on this month's experiment to learn math and conquer my math anxiety, and I also reviewed some of the ups and downs I've had in 2015, the most eventful year of my life so far.

If I can function after staying up all night (thanks to a late nap, accidentally ingesting caffeine, and illegal fireworks exploding all around my apartment), I hope to start 2016 by jumping right into my next projects! I also have a few days left of daily video blogs (I'll stop on day 100), and then I look forward to some new experiments!
