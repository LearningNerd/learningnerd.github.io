title: "On math myths and my life goals (Math Immersion Month Day 14)"
cats: math

A very vloggy video in which I share a couple favorite new books, discuss four myths about math, and rant about my life goals and my crazy idea for next year.

See [my day 11 blog post]({% post_url 2015-12-11-math-day-11 %}) for the written version of my thoughts on taking a year off to just have fun learning stuff before I get another full-time job; I said basically the same thing at the end of [today's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RHMKy4V6pw).

## Additions to my Wall of Questions
See the first set of questions and creation of the Wall of Questions in [my video for day 7]({% post_url 2015-12-07-math-day-7 %}).

- What are the must-see math movies?
- Why do the digits of factors of 11 add up to 0 if alternating adding and subtracting?
- What is cryptology, its basic principles, and why is it cool?
- Why are people so fascinated with prime numbers?
- What patterns are there to prime numbers (if any)?
- What is number theory and why do people like it?
- What are the "five basic rules" (according to [Alex]({% post_url 2015-12-07-math-day-7 %})) for doing proofs?
- What do mathematicians think the word "introduction" means?!
- What is graph theory all about?

- What other types of geometrical spaces exist, and what's the difference between them?
- How many mathematicians are there, are what are their demographics?
- What do mathematicians talk about when they're together (if their work is so highly specialized that they don't know what many of their colleagues are working on)?
- What are the best examples of how pure mathematics became unexpectedly useful?
- How do knots work and what are the basics of knot theory?
- What does "breaking the rules" mean in mathematics?
