<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/autotelic">Autotelic</a></em> is an adjective that means "having within itself the purpose of its existence".

I'm taking a creativity workshop class, which had me read part of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Flow-Psychology-Discovery-Invention/dp/0060928204">Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention</a></em>. If you haven't already heard of it, read Wikipedia's entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> for a summary -- or, better yet, watch Csikszentmihalyi himself discuss "flow" in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html" title="Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow">this TED Talks video</a>.

The state of "flow" basically occurs when you're completely focused on a task. It's often called "being in the zone" -- you know, like when you look up and suddenly 5 hours have passed. One of the characteristics of this state is that the activity is <em>autotelic</em>; you're running just for the sake of running, or painting for the sake of painting. If you're doing it for fame or fortune, it isn't autotelic.

<em>Autotelic</em> comes from the Greek roots <em>auto-</em>, "self", and <em>-telic</em>, having an "end" or "goal". Combine the two and you get a self-goal -- a goal within itself.

What are your favorite autotelic activities?
