<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/indefatigable"><em>Indefatigable</em></a> is a long adjective that means "incapable of being tired out". I found this word from a post on <a href="http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2007/05/satees_for_the_.html">swissmiss</a> about t-shirts for babies that feature SAT words.

They're so cute, I'd buy one for myself if it came in a larger size! They have a lot of other great words, too -- some of which I'll have to look up.
