title: "Borromean rings, braids, onions, and a 3D-printed puzzle (Math Immersion Month Day 9)"
category: math
---

I made my first 3D-printed object and learned about Borromean rings, braids and onion rings, plus a minute of quantum mechanics! And I confirmed [my first interview with a mathematician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O86FJ0ayH0)!
