This might make me sound like a dork (or a nerd), but I associate this word with the cartoon series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Arnold!">"Hey Arnold!"</a>, where I heard it for the first time in an episode about a spelling bee. I never bothered to look it up until now.

A <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pasquinade">pasquinade</a> is "a satire or lampoon, especially one that ridicules a specific person, traditionally written and posted in a public place." You can also use the word as a verb, meaning "to ridicule with a pasquinade".

Wikipedia's entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasquinade">Pasquinade</a> explains the word's interesting origin:

<blockquote>
Pasquin (Italian <em>Pasquino</em>) was the name ordinary Romans gave to a battered ancient statue.... [I]t became the custom for those who wanted to criticize the Pope or individuals in his government [...] to write satirical poems [...] and attach them to this statue.
</blockquote>

<em>Pasquinade</em> is a pretty cool word, but it's rarely used. In fact, it doesn't appear even once on Google News. I find that hard to believe, considering there must be more people to make fun of now than ever before! And isn't the internet basically just one huge Pasquino statue?
