To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nutate">nutate</a></em> generally means to "rock, sway, or nod; usually involuntarily". It comes from Latin <em>nutare</em>, meaning "to nod repeatedly". But the noun <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nutation">nutation</a></em> has several specific meanings:

<ol>
	<li>"an act or instance of nodding one's head, esp. involuntarily or spasmodically"</li>
	<li>"a wobble in a spinning gyroscope or other rotating body"</li>
	<li>"a slight curving or circular movement in a stem, as of a twining plant, caused by irregular growth rates of different parts."</li>
	<li>"a small, cyclic variation of the Earth's axis of rotation with a period of 18.6 years, caused by tidal forces (mostly due to the gravity of the Moon)"</li>
</ol>

As you can see, it's quite a scientific word. I learned it from <em>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</em>, in an episode where MIT Physics Professor Peter Fisher helped Conan beat his ring-spinning record. (Read about it on the <a href="http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/pulse/faculty_at_mit/physics_prof_peter_fisher_on_c.shtml" title="Physics Prof. Peter Fisher on Conan">MIT blog</a>.) Professor Fisher defined <em>nutate</em> as "to get floppy", which isn't entirely accurate, but it made a much better set-up for Conan's silly double entendre. :roll:
