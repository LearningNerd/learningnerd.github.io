title: "First look at NAND2Tetris hardware simulator (Daily Learning Vlog #94)"
category: vlog

I spent 30 minutes poking around the software tools for [NAND2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/), so here's what that looked like. Boring? Yes. But I'm having fun experimenting with how the act of documenting my learning process in different ways can alter the learning process itself. It seems to spur me on to keep trying when I might normally give up.

No notes for today, because I barely spent any time on this aside from reading the [NAND2Tetris hardware simulator tutorial](http://nand2tetris.org/tutorials/PDF/Hardware%20Simulator%20Tutorial.pdf) (PDF). I think I am somewhat comfortable with using the hardware simulator at least, so that's one thing I can check off from yesterday's list of next steps! I'll copy the rest of it here to remind me to look at it tomorrow:

## Next steps

- Learn how to write HDL -- read [Appendix A](http://nand2tetris.org/chapters/appendix%20A.pdf) (PDF) sections A1 to A6 
- Figure out how to combine Nand gates into several other gates according to the project files at the end of [Chapter 1](http://nand2tetris.org/chapters/chapter%2001.pdf) (PDF).

## Time breakdown

Note: "Filming/setup" time only includes setup, because the rest of the time was categorized as study time. (Give or take a couple brief distractions.)

- Video production time: 1 hour 28 min
  - Script writing/preparation: none
  - Filming/setup: 5 min
  - Video editing: 1 hour 8 min
  - Publishing: 10 min
- Study time: 30 min
