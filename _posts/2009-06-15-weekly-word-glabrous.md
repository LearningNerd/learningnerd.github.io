The adjective <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glabrous">glabrous</a></em> sounds like what it means: "smooth", "bald", or more specifically, "having a surface without hairs or projections".

This word is usually used to describe plants, but I think it's a shame that it rarely shows up in any other context. There are plenty of glabrous globs of goop that need to be described as such!

At least I found <em>one</em> example sentence that uses <em>glabrous</em> creatively: "Colleen had her favorite hat on, and I decided to drive glabrous and unadorned; the sun felt wonderful and there would be plenty of time for hats later on" (<a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-4791-SF-International-Travel-Examiner~y2009m5d25-Road-Trip-Beer-tour-of-wine-country" title="Road Trip: Beer Tour of Wine Country">Bob Ecker</a>). I thought that was a humorous way to describe a bald guy driving a convertible.
