To <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bork"><em>bork</em></a> is "to attack (a candidate or public figure) systematically, esp. in the media." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bork" title="Bork on Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> has a longer description:

<blockquote>a term used by American conservatives for an orchestrated campaign to discredit a candidate for high public office by fostering belief that he has expressed opinions on issues of public importance that no reasonable, well-intentioned person could agree with and that would have disastrous consequences if given effect, without seriously attempting to rebut his (actual) opinions on the merits. Named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork">Robert Bork</a>, whose nomination to the Supreme Court (according to his supporters) was defeated in such a way.</blockquote>

I've never come across this word before. It sounds like it should be from a bad sci-fi movie, not a legal scholar's name. But I like how it sounds, so I'll be looking for an opportunity to use it.
