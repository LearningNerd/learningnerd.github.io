<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/verisimilitude">Verisimilitude</a> - <em>n. the appearance or semblance of truth, or something, as an assertion, having merely the appearance of truth.</em>

According to the oh-so-wonderful <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=verisimilitude">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, the word comes from Latin <em>verisimilitudo</em> "likeness to truth," which comes from <em>verus</em> "true" + <em>similis</em> "like, similar".

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude">Wikipedia</a> has an article about verisimilitude as it applies to writers and actors, but the entry for Stephen Colbert's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness">Truthiness</a> was much more interesting. With great verisimilitude, Stephen Colbert portrays a character who believes in verisimilitudinous ideas (probably because he relies on truthiness).
