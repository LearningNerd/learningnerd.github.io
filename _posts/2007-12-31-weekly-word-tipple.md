May you tipple your way to a very happy new year! And have a drink for me, because I'm not 21 yet. :( To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tipple">tipple</a></em> means "to drink intoxicating liquor, esp. habitually or to some excess."

As a noun, a tipple is "alcoholic liquor" or "a serving of drink (usually alcoholic) drawn from a keg". It can also mean "a place where loaded cars are emptied by tipping".

The <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tipple">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> explains part of the word's evolution:
<ul>
	<li>1396 - <em>tippler</em> means "seller of alcoholic liquors"</li>
	<li>1531 - <em>tipple</em> means "sell alcoholic liquor by retail"</li>
	<li>1560 - <em>tipple</em> means "drink (alcoholic beverage) too much"</li>
	<li>1580 - <em>tippler</em> means "habitual drinker"</li>
</ul>
The word <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tipsy">tipsy</a></em> is related to <em>tipple</em>. Apparently a <em>tipsy-cake</em> is a "cake saturated with wine or liquor". Mmm, intoxicating.
