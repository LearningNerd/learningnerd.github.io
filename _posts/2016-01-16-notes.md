Time for more computer science studying with [NAND2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/)! [Yesterday]({% post_url 2016-01-15-notes %}) I read [chapter 2 of *The Elements of Computing Systems*](http://nand2tetris.org/chapters/chapter%2001.pdf) (PDF) and today I watched the video lectures on [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/nand2tetris1-001) and started building the [second project](http://nand2tetris.org/02.php).

The video lectures were alright. They helped me review what I had read in the book yesterday. But I did feel a bit lost when they got to the part about converting decimal numbers into binary. How am I supposed to know how to break up any number into factors of 2?! Hmm. Trial and error, I guess. That was a neat trick, actually.

Then I started implementing the chips -- first on paper, then in the hardware simulator:

- **Half adder:** 6 min
- **Full adder:** 8 min
- **16-bit adder:** 6 min
- **Incrementer:** 7 min 

These were so easy, I wondered if maybe I had actually done this before and forgotten about it! In any case, it was fun! The first project seemed to take an eternity to complete, so this was refreshing.

I still have yet to do the main part of the project, though: the arithmetic logical unit (ALU)! So I have that challenge to look forward to.

## Questions

- What's the best technique for converting decimal into binary?

## Learning summary (#TIL)

- Implemented the half adder, full adder, 16-bit adder and incrementer!
- Learned a technique for converting decimal numbers into binary.

## Next steps

- Finish building the [second project](http://nand2tetris.org/02.php).

## Time breakdown

- Study time: 1 hour 27 min
  - Watching NAND2Tetris videos: 1 hour
  - Building project 2: 27 min
