<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rodomontade">Rodomontade</a></em> is "vainglorious boasting or bragging". It's also an adjective meaning "bragging", and as a verb it means "to brag".

<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Mar.25.2008" title="Rodomontade">Merriam-Webster</a> picked it as their word of the day a while ago, explaining its origin in Italian poetry:

<blockquote>
Rodomonte was a fierce and boastful king in <em>Orlando Innamorato</em>, Count Matteo M. Boiardo's late 15th century epic, and later in the sequel <em>Orlando Furioso</em>, written by poet Lodovico Ariosto in 1516. In the late 16th century, English speakers began to use "rodomont" as a noun meaning "braggart." Soon afterwards, "rodomontade" entered the language.... The noun "rodomont" is no longer used in English, but "rodomontade" is still with us.
</blockquote>

This reminds me of another word I learned a while ago: <a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-thrasonical">thrasonical</a>, which means "boastful" and is also named after a fictional character.
