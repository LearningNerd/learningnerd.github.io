<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pernoctation">Pernoctation</a></em>, a not-so-common word, means "the act or state of passing the whole night; a remaining all night".

There isn't much to say about this word, really. It's simple and straightforward. <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=per" title="Per on Online Etymology Dictionary">Per</a></em> (meaning "through") + <em>noct</em> (meaning "night", as in <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nocturnal" title="Nocturnal on Online Etymology Dictionary">nocturnal</a>) + <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=-ation" title="-ation on Dictionary.com">ation</a></em> (a common suffix meaning "action or process"). There you have it: <em>pernoctation</em>, the action of staying through the whole night.

I haven't found any examples of this word used in a sentence, though. In fact, my spell checker doesn't even recognize it as a word! But I'm going to bring it back into common usage. I know plenty of students at college that could make good use of it. (They're always jealous of me and my daily nine hours of sleep. ;) )
