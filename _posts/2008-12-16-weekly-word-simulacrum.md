A <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/simulacrum">simulacrum</a></em> is "a slight, unreal, or superficial likeness or semblance", or "an effigy, image, or representation". Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum">Simulacrum</a> entry explains it in terms of philosophy, film, and even caricatures. Here's the blurb on the word's history:

<blockquote>
"...first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation of another thing, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god; by the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original"
</blockquote>

Maybe the contradictory meanings of <em>simulacrum</em> reflect conflicting feelings about making representations of gods and other things; some people liked the idea, while others criticized it because a representation can never perfectly reflect reality. You could get lost in some serious philosophical ramblings on that topic!
