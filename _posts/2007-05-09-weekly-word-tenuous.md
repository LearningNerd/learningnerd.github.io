<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tenuous"><em>Tenuous</em></a> is an adjective with a few meanings:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>thin or slender in form, as a thread.</li>
	<li>lacking a sound basis, as reasoning; unsubstantiated; weak</li>
	<li>thin in consistency; rare or rarefied.</li>
	<li>of slight importance or significance; unsubstantial</li>
	<li>lacking in clarity; vague</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

It comes from the Latin word <em>tenius</em>, meaning <em>thin</em>. I'm guessing that all the other meanings developed later -- and it's interesting how they're all more or less related. A search  for "tenuous" on <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> shows many different uses, like "Oil Market Reaches Tenuous Balance", "a tenuous grip on reality", "tenuous reasoning", and even a "tenuous nose injury", whatever that means.
