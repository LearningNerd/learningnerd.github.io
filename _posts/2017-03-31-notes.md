Just a few notes from working on my mob coding app:

**Milestones:**

  - Finished and cleaned up version 0 (`branch v0-shared-editor`), collaborative real-time text-editing (no turn-based system).

  - Version 1 (branch `v1-turnbased-simple`) with turn-based system now works!

**Questions:**

  - When a user is temporarily disconnected and then reconnects, what's the best way to maintain their state in the game? (Currently they lose their place in the turn order, and their username is reset.)

  - How can I prevent the user from typing into the text box but still allow the user to use the keyboard to navigate/select/copy the text when it's not their turn?
