Last week was completely overscheduled, and I was completely overwhelmed. And I overslept a lot, too. Maybe I needed a break? Whatever it was, at least today I seem to be feeling a bit more confident in my ability to stay on track again. And it&#39;s a new month, so I&#39;m setting a new goal:

**Goal for June:** Wake up by 7am every day, then exercise a bit, shower and get dressed, and then start working on web development projects/studying by 8am, and work on it for _at least_ 25 minutes, but with a chunk of 3 hours carved out for it every day. (Phew! Is that specific enough?)

**Goal for this week:** Finally, _actually_ make the website for the meetup group, and don&#39;t worry about how good it is. Just start making it! Even if it&#39;s just customizing somebody else&#39;s template for now.

Other stuff on my plate: some projects at work (which hopefully mean more web development practice!) and moving to a new apartment (but at least it&#39;s just across the hallway in the same building).

Other stuff on my mind: deciding if I want to keep blogging in this Jekyll blog here, if I want to move back to my old WordPress blog, or if I want to find a way to merge the two together.

**Stuff I learned today:**

*   I learned that some Jekyll themes use lots of Ruby gems as dependencies and some of them just don&#39;t want to install on Windows. _Grr!_
*   Installed [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), the CSS preprocessor, along with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), a library for Sass, and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/), a grid framework for Bourbon, which I can also use with [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) and [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/). (Am I studying to be a web developer or a bartender?)
*   Started learning about the magic of CSS proprocessors, hoping that if it makes CSS less tedious then maybe I&#39;ll stop avoiding it!
*   Watched part of [this video on Sass libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ItNE_DX6Cc).
