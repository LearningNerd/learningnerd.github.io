Unfortunately, I'm socially well-adjusted and easily understood, according to this little <a href="http://in-sidemarketing.blogspot.com/2007/07/test-your-vocabulary-part-three.html">Vocabulary Quiz from Word Sell</a>. One word I thought I knew was <em>bricolage</em>. "Oh, bricolage, I've heard that before! Isn't it -- no, never mind. Maybe it was -- no, that's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricola">Ricola</a>. Argh!" I guess I'm not as much of a word nerd as I thought.

It turns out that a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bricolage">bricolage</a> is "a construction made of whatever materials are at hand".

Wikipedia's entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage">bricolage</a> lists uses of the word in different disciplines, from postmodern art to programming. It also says this about its etymology:

<blockquote>
It is borrowed from the French word <em>bricolage</em>, from the verb <em>bricoler</em> -- equivalent to the English "do-it-yourself", the core meaning in French being, however, "fiddle, tinker"...
</blockquote>

I love the sound of <em>bricolage</em>. Even though it makes me think of Swiss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphorn">alphorns</a>, it sounds so wonderfully French! I also love the concepts behind it: DIY (do it yourself), creativity, variety, practicality, frugality... What's not to love?
