A <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/platitude">platitude</a></em> is "a flat, dull, or trite remark, esp. one uttered as if it were fresh or profound". It can also refer to "lack of originality" in general.

It comes directly from the French word <em>platitude</em>, which means "flatness". Unsurprisingly enough, <em>platitude</em> is related to the word <em>plate</em>.

This word sounds like a synonym of <em><a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-truism">truism</a></em>, "an obvious truth (often hardly worth mentioning)". It also reminds me of a <em><a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-pleonasm">pleonasm</a></em>, which is "a redundant expression". I wonder how many more words there are for redundant or unoriginal phrases. Can you think of any others?
