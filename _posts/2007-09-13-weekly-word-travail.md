<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/travail">Travail</a></em> is "painfully difficult or burdensome work", "suffering resulting from mental or physical hardship", or "the pain of childbirth". As a verb, <em>travail</em> means "to suffer the pangs of childbirth" or "to toil or exert oneself".

The word comes from French, but it can be traced back to Latin <em>tripalium</em>, a torture device. According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=travail" title="Travail">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, the word <em>tripalium</em> is "probably from L. <em>tripalis</em> 'having three stakes' (from <em>tria</em>, <em>tres</em> 'three' + <em>palus</em> 'stake'), which sounds ominous, but the exact notion is obscure."

Those Romans had it right, though: work is definitely a form of torture. So is childbirth. (I <em>so</em> don't want to have kids!)

But anyway, <em>travail</em> is a useful word. It isn't particularly common, but it isn't obscure, either. It's just specific. If you're travailing, you're not just working or toiling; you're also being tortured! (Again, childbirth. Ouch.)
