The word <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Mar.26.2009">dross</a></em> is a noun that means "something that is base, trivial, or inferior", "an impurity", or more specifically, "the scum that forms on the surface of molten metal".

It's related to the word <em>dregs</em>, a noun referring to the sediment that forms in some liquids. Both <em>dregs</em> and <em>dross</em> are used figuratively to describe things that nobody wants.

Similar to <em>dross</em> (and just as yucky-sounding), the word <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag">slag</a></em> refers to a byproduct of smelting metal. What exactly is the difference between dross and slag? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dross" title="Dross">Wikipedia</a> explains that "dross, as a solid, is distinguished from slag, which is a liquid." So there you have it.

Solid or liquid, the words <em>dregs</em>, <em>dross</em>, and <em>slag</em> all sound exactly like what they are.
