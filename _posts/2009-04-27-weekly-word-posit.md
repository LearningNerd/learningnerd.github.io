I've been reading a lot of scholarly journals lately for a school research paper, and I keep running across the word <em>posit</em>, as in "the first hypothesis posits that..." The verb <em>to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/posit">posit</a></em> simply means "to place" or "to put". More specifically, it also means "to lay down or assume as a fact or principle" or "to put forward, as for consideration or study".

Even though <em>posit</em> comes straight from the Latin word <em>ponere</em>, "to place or to put", I've never seen anyone use <em>posit</em> in that literal sense. You don't <em>posit</em> a book on your desk; you just <em>put</em> it on your desk. For whatever reason, the word <em>posit</em> is only used in the figurative sense: "posit an opinion", "posit a theory", or "posit a solution".

The word <em>posit</em> may not come up too often, but it's related to the words <em>position</em>, <em>posture</em>, <em>deposit</em>, <em>depot</em>, <em>repository</em>, <em>suppository</em>, <em>suppose</em>, and more. Those words don't have that much in common, but if you think about it, they all involve the concept of place, placement, or putting something somewhere (either literally or figuratively).
