<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/innumerate">Innumerate</a></em> means "unfamiliar with mathematical concepts and methods" -- in other words, <em>innumeracy</em> is another way of saying "numerical illiteracy".

I never knew there was a word for it, but I'm definitely familiar with the concept. Even though I'm technically a math major, I'm still innumerate when it comes to leaving a tip! Funny how you can be good at calculus without being able to do simple arithmetic.

The opposite of innumeracy is <em>numeracy</em> (short for "numerical literacy"). According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeracy" title="Numeracy">Wikipedia</a>, those two terms were coined by two different people, thirty years apart.
