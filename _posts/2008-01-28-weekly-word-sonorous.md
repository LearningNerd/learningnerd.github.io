The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sonorous">sonorous</a></em> means "capable of giving out a sound", "rich and full in sound", "grandiloquent", or "loud, deep, or resonant". It derives from the Latin word <em>sonor</em>, meaning <em>sound</em>.

The noun form <em>sonority</em> means the "quality of being resonant", so it overlaps the definition of the word <em>resonance</em>. But in linguistics, sonority has a specific meaning: "the degree to which a speech sound is like a vowel". Another related word is <em>sonant</em>, "having sound". In linguistics, a sonant refers to "a speech sound that by itself makes a syllable".

You're probably familiar with the sonant's counterpart: the consonant. The word <em>consonant</em> comes from a Latin word meaning "to sound together", which is why <em>consonant</em> as an adjective means "harmonious" and "in agreement".

The qualities of sound have led to all sorts of sound-related metaphors in the English language, just like the qualities of an island evolved into words like <em>isolate</em>, <em>insulate</em>, and <em><a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-insularity">insularity</a></em>. I'm sure we have countless other groups of words that follow a similar pattern. Do you know of any off the top of your head? I'd love to see some sort of diagram showing the evolution of words like these!
