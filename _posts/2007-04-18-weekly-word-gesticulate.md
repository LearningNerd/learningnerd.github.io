To <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gesticulate"><em>gesticulate</em></a> means "to make or use gestures, esp. in an animated or excited manner with or instead of speech."

From the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gesticulate">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, it comes from Latin "<em>gesticulari</em> 'to gesture, mimic,' from <em>gesticulus</em> 'a mimicking gesture,' dim. of <em>gestus</em> 'gesture, carriage, posture'."

A quick search for "gesticulate" on Google News revealed that six out of the 17 results use the phrase "gesticulate wildly". This made me curious, so I searched on Google:

<ul>
	<li>"gesture" - about 15,900,000 results</li>
	<li>"gesticulate" - about 159,000 results</li>
	<li>"gesture wildly" - about 676 results</li>
	<li>"gesticulate wildly" - about 984 results</li>
</ul>

Interesting, isn't it? Even though <em>gesture</em> is used 100 times more often than <em>gesticulate</em>, the phrase "gesticulate wildly" is still more common than "gesture wildly". Well, if you're going to describe an action as happening "wildly", I guess it works better with a word that also sounds wild.

The definition for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gesture"><em>gesture</em></a> is simply "to make or use a gesture or gestures", but the definition for <em>gesticulate</em> means to make gestures "in an animated or excited manner". Wouldn't that make "gesticulate wildly" a bit of a <a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-pleonasm">pleonasm</a> (a redundant phrase)? Or is it an idiom that has some extra meaning?
