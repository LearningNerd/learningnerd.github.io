Something that's <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ductile">ductile</a></em> is "easily molded or shaped", "easily drawn into wire or hammered thin", or "easily influenced".

It's actually related to the word <em>duke</em>, because both words come from the Latin word <em>ducere</em> "to lead". <em>Ductile</em> came about through the Latin word <em>ductilis</em>, meaning "that may be led or drawn" (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ductile" title="Ductile - Online Etymology Dictionary">OED</a>). Still, I think the connection is a bit of a stretch. But I guess if you can be led by someone, you might be also be easily influenced.

Despite its broad definitions, I've found that <em>ductile</em> is almost always used to describe metal. Scientifically speaking, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility">ductility</a> is "a mechanical property which describes how much plastic deformation a material can sustain before fracture occurs". I thought that maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_tape#Etymology" title="Duct Tape - Etymology - Wikipedia">duct tape</a> was somehow related to this, but nobody else thinks so!
