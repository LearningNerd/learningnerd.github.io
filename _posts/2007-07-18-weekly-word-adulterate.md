As a verb, <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adulterate">to adulterate</a></em> means to "corrupt, debase, or make impure by adding a foreign or inferior substance". The adjective, either <em>adulterated</em> or <em>adulterate</em> (pronounced like the adjective form of <em>moderate</em>), means "mixed with impurities".

The word <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unadulterated">unadulterated</a></em> is much more common, as in the phrase "pure, unadulterated fun." A Google search for "adulterated" has about 1,260,000 results, while a search for "unadulterated" has 2,300,000. However, the same searches on Google News have about 300 results for both words. I guess those journalists just love to write about "adulterated pet food" and the countless other things that are now being adulterated.

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=adulteration" title="Adulteration">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, the word comes from Latin "<em>adulterare</em> 'corrupt, debauch,' from <em>ad-</em> 'to' + L.L. <em>alterare</em> 'to alter'". <em>Adultery</em> comes from that same Latin word, but <em>adult</em> actually doesn't seem to be related.
