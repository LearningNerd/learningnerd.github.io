## Real-time notes

**11:10am:** Off to a slow start today, but at least I took care of a bunch of emails and event planning work. I'm still sleepy but coffee is helping, and I'm looking forward to a nice lunch with my dad and stepmom soon. I found some cool stuff on the internet, some of which I'm saving in the ["gathering string"](#gathering-string) section of this blog post. And now I want to take another look at that bug from yesterday and try to sketch out a couple other scenarios for what might happen when the current player disconnects before the end of their turn in my mob coding app.

**11:35am:** I sketched out a couple more scenarios and identified another small solution that might actually work: instead of tracking the *index* of the previous and current player on the server, maybe I should just track their IDs! That way, the server will should have the ID of any player who just disconnected, and the client-side checks for whether to fork/edit or only edit should be accurate! (Right now, the server can either send `undefined` for the previous player ID or it can send the *wrong* previous player ID!) I wonder if that will solve it. Ah, I feel so hungry and so sleepy right now! But I just can't let this one go. I want to understand this crazy system that I've created, even though I know there are more efficient ways to solve this bug.

Here's another important piece of the puzzle that I missed yesterday: the owner of the Gist is always the previous player who successfully completed their turn. So if there are three players in the game, and player #1 finished their turn but player #2 disconnected before their turn ended, then when the turn passes control to player #3, the Gist owner is still player #1! In those scenarios, things actually work out fine most of the time -- again, just by happy accident! But what if *multiple* players in a row get disconnected before their turn ends?

**Scenario if multiple players disconnect on their turns:**

  1. Three players are in the game, and Player #1 completes their turn. (Gist owner: #1)

  2. Player #2 disconnects before their turn ends. (Gist owner: #1)

  3. Player #3 also disconnects before their turn ends. (Gist owner: #1)

  4. Player #1 begins their turn, and they should *not* fork the Gist since they own it! But the game state looks like this: previous player is #3, current player is #1, and since they don't match, Player #1 should fork and edit the Gist. And that leads to an error from GitHub!

This little thought experiment shows that changing the server-side code to track player IDs *still* wouldn't solve the problem, as long as my condition for deciding whether to fork a Gist relies on comparing the previous player to the current player! So here's one possible solution: redefine "previous player" to mean "the previous player who successfully completed their turn", because that's *really* the condition that decides what should happen next. In other words, who's the owner of the Gist?

**11:53am:** I still have some doubts as to whether my logic is correct here, because like I mentioned, I'm hungry and sleepy. But I'm in luck, because it's time to leave for lunch! I just need to walk up the street, but that does take a few minutes. Hopefully by the time I'm back from lunch (and maybe a nap), the solution to this problem will crystalize in my mind and all doubts about my logic will be resolved. Taking a step back usually helps with that stuff. Just like in IT, sometimes all you need to do is turn it off and back on again!

...

**1:51pm:** Back from a nice lunch with my folks, followed by a visit to the new Wilshire Grand building. The hotel lobby on the 70th floor has an amazing view! I definitely want to check out their rooftop bar on the 73rd floor sometime. Maybe even today! Nah, probably not. Then we stopped by the coworking space and they met a couple of my friends and here I am again, back at my computer. I feel a spike of anxiety right now, probably just anticipating the entire rest of the day, being anxious about the possibility of future anxiety attacks. I wish that sort of infinite loop was easier to fix. Maybe that's why I like computer programming: a sense of control! Anyway, I'm practicing my new response to this anxious feeling: diving into work. With time I'll hopefully become more confident that it really does help. Right now, I'm still not sure. Anyway, OK, back to where I left off, at least for a little while before I take a nap.

So I'm pretty sure that all the work I did the other day to resolve [issue #20 ("Game state should track previous and current player for Gist forking/editing logic")](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/mob-coding/issues/20) and [issue #24 ("If current player disconnects, next turn can trigger unwanted Gist fork")](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/mob-coding/issues/24) was for nothing! I made an assumption and ran with it, but that assumption turned out to be entirely incorrect! The assumption was that the Gist forking/editing logic depended on the turn logic (the changing of previous and current players), but it doesn't! Well, it does, but only *indirectly*.

Instead of starting from first principles and looking at the root of the other actions in this system, I got caught up in the tangled mess of secondary effects, treating the symptoms instead of the cause! I think the situation can be summed up well this way: instead of thinking of my app as one complicated state machine, it's actually more like two or three smaller state machines that communicate with each other. My code should reflect that!

I could be stubborn and implement a solution that increments the "previous player" only when each player successfully completes their turn, but that's just a bunch of extra logic and extra work to accomplish exactly what I identified as a solution the other day: I should just check if the current player is the owner of the Gist or not! I'm already tracking the current Gist URL as part of the game state, so it wouldn't be much extra work to also track its owner. OK, problem solved! Now I just need to clean up my GitHub issues, add [this as a new issue](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/mob-coding/issues/26), and close [my previous pull request](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/mob-coding/pull/25).

**2:38pm:** Done! I also spent some time looking through my code to identify exactly where I need to change things, and I made a nice list of tasks with checkboxes inside the new issue. I also updated my project log in the README for the project, just to keep this all straight in my head. I think I can see it all clearly now, finally! I'm ready for a nap soon, but first I'll start on editing the code.

**3:19pm:** All done and pretty thoroughly tested, and it works like a charm! Here's the updated flowchart (just one tiny change for one of those conditional statements):

Woohoo! OK, I think I'm ready for my nap now. When I return, I might work on the state machine diagram some more or just take care of some more little refactoring tasks.

...

**7:34pm:** That was an *epic* nap! I wish I didn't sleep so long, but maybe I needed it. When I woke up, it felt like the morning and I had a craving for cereal and milk and waffles and eggs and bacon. ðŸ˜… 

Anyway, I forgot to mention *yet another* edge case that I hadn't considered until after fixing this bug once and for all: what if the same user logs into the app multiple times? Surely my previous logic wouldn't work, because regardless of the state of the turn-changing mechanic, a user can never fork their own Gist! This brings up a larger issue (which I just posted as [a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/mob-coding/issues/28)): there's ultimately no way for me to prevent players from cheating, because even with a full login system and sessions and all that, users could still create multiple accounts and cheat that way. Some tools for moderation will be important later on.
