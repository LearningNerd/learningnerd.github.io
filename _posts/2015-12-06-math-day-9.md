title: "My mathy interview with Alex, a random cool dude! (Math Immersion Month Day 8)"
category: Math
---

I made my first 3D-printed object and learned about Borromean rings, braids and onion rings, plus a minute of quantum mechanics! And I confirmed my first interview with a mathematician! Tomorrow (December 10th) I'm live-streaming my conversation with [Henry Segerman](http://www.segerman.org/) at 6:00pm Pacific Standard Time -- [post your questions here!](https://plus.google.com/events/crh18rmoumgj2ee8em1tcsa8o5ss)
