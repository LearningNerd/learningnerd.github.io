This was the first time I've [filmed an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhxojqFK-Co) with someone other than my parents, woohoo! We talked a bit about number theory, cryptography, a must-see math movie ("Pi"), and why math is cool! Big thanks to [Null Space Labs](http://032.la/) for providing an awesome hackerspace full of nerds who are willing to be on camera! ;)

Today I also made two or three half-finished videos, which I'll finish up and share later. Lots of cool mathy stuff happening!! But it's very late and I need to get some sleep.
