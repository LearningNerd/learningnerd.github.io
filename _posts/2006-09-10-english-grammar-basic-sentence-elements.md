The basic parts of a sentence fall into two cats: the subject and the predicate. Know them well, because you can't have a sentence without them!
<h2>Subjects</h2>
The subject performs the action of the sentence. It can be a <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/08/29/english-parts-of-speech-nouns-and-pronouns/" title="Nouns and Pronouns">noun</a>, <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/06/english-grammar-types-of-phrases/" title="Types of Phrases">noun phrase</a>, or <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/08/english-grammar-types-of-clauses/" title="Types of Clauses">noun clause</a>. To analyze sentences, grammarians have distinguished three kinds of subjects:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Complete Subject</strong> - "<em>The old, dusty books on the table </em>haven't been read in years." The complete subject includes the entire noun phrase -- usually everything before the verb.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simple Subject</strong> - "<em>books". </em>The simple subject is the main noun or pronoun stripped of all modifiers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/dictionaries/english/data/d0081795.html" title="Dictionary of English - Compound Subject"><strong>Compound Subject</strong></a> - "<em>The cowardly mailman and the huge, barking dog</em> didn't get along very well." A compound subject consists of two or more subjects linked together by <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/04/english-parts-of-speech-prepositions-conjunctions-and-interjections/" title="Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections">conjunctions</a>. Note: the simple subject of that sentence would be "<em>mailman and dog</em>".</li>
</ul>
See <a target="_blank" href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/subjects.htm">Sentence Subjects</a> for a closer look at subjects and subject-verb inversion (placing a subject after the verb in a sentence, as in "How is Bob?").
<h2>Predicates</h2>
As with subjects, predicates can be classified as complete predicates, simple predicates, and compound predicates; see this page in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/CWS/wWORKSHOP/writer_resources/grammar_handbook/subjects_predicates.htm#predicates" title="Subjects and Predicates - Predicates">UIUC Grammar Handbook</a> for more. To form a complete sentence, the predicate must include a <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/08/31/english-parts-of-speech-verbs/" title="Verbs">verb</a> (a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/finite-verb.html" title="UsingEnglish.com Glossary - Finite Verbs">finite verb</a>, more specifically). It can also include objects, complements, and adverbials.
<h3>Objects</h3>
The object is the receiver of the action in a sentence: "He broke <em>the table</em>" or "He threw <em>the ball</em>." Like subjects, objects can be any word or group of words functioning as a noun, and each type of object can also be categorized as a complete, simple, or compound object. Categorized by their different functions within a sentence, the three types of objects are:
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/eduweb/grammar/course/sentence/2_2c.htm"><strong>Direct Object</strong></a> - "I wrote <em>a letter</em>." (What did I write? <em>A letter</em>.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/eduweb/grammar/course/sentence/2_2d.htm"><strong>Indirect Object</strong></a> - "I wrote a letter to <em>my friend</em>." (Who did I write a letter to? <em>My friend</em>.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Prepositional Object</strong> - "I wrote on <em>the paper</em>." (What did I write on? <em>The paper</em>.) A thread on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.englishforums.com/English/PrepositionalObjectComplement-PrepositionOtherConfusingStuff/bnmrr/Post.htm" title="Prepositional Object, Complement of Preposition and other confusing stuff.">EnglishForums.com</a> discusses prepositional objects and their potential for confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complements</h3>
Complements (also called predicatives) complete the predicate by modifying a noun in the sentence; <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/08/31/english-parts-of-speech-verbs/#types" title="Verbs - Types of Verbs">copulas or linking verbs</a> require a complement to form a complete sentence.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Subject Complement</strong> - "The car is <em>new</em>." The subject complement follows a linking verb and modifies the subject. It can be a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sil.org/LINGUISTICS/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPredicateAdjective.htm">predicate adjective</a> (He is <em>happy</em>), a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sil.org/LINGUISTICS/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPredicateNoun.htm">predicate noun</a> (He is <em>the boss</em>), or an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29#Adverbials_as_complements" title="Wikipedia - Complement - Adverbials as Complements">adverbial complement</a> (He is <em>in the house</em>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bartelby.com/68/80/4180.html" title="The Columbia Guide to Standard American English - Object Complement"><strong>Object Complement</strong></a> - "I painted my room <em>purple</em>." The object complement modifies the direct object, either by describing it or renaming it (They elected him <em>governor</em>). Object complements can cause some confusion; check out this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.painintheenglish.com/post.php?id=815" title="P.I.T.E - Adverb or adjective? Or something else?">Pain in the English</a> post. Also see Wikipedia's note on <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29#Object_complements" title="Complement - Object Complements">Object Complements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adjective Complement</strong> - "He was happy <em>to help</em>." The adjective complement is a special case in which a group of words modifies an adjective. If removed, the adjective complement leaves a grammatically complete sentence, but the meaning of the sentence changes. The <a target="_blank" href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/gerunds.htm#adjective_complement" title="Gerunds and Infinitives - Their Noun Roles - Adjective Complement">CCC Guide to Grammar and Writing</a> explains the use of <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/06/english-grammar-types-of-phrases/" title="Types of Phrases">infinitive phrases</a> as adjective complements. Note: predicative adjectives are also sometimes called adjective complements.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Verb Complement</strong> - Some grammarians use the term "verb complement" to refer to direct and indirect objects (see the "Objects" section above), while others use it to refer to a complement occuring after a linking verb (a subject complement).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adverbials</h3>
An <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/02/english-parts-of-speech-adjectives-determiners-and-adverbs/#adverbials" title="Adjectives, Determiners, and Adverbs - Adverbials">adverbial</a> is an <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/02/english-parts-of-speech-adjectives-determiners-and-adverbs/#adverbs" title="Adjectives, Determiners, and Adverbs - Adverbs">adverb</a>, <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/06/english-grammar-types-of-phrases/" title="Types of Phrases">adverbial phrase</a>, or <a href="http://learningnerd.com/2006/09/08/english-grammar-types-of-clauses/" title="Types of Clauses">adverbial clause</a>: any word or group of words that acts as an adverb within a sentence. They usually modify verbs, but they can also modify the whole sentence. Unlike an adverbial complement (He is <em>in the house</em>), an adverbial isn't needed to complete a sentence (He had lunch <em>in the house</em> or He had lunch).
