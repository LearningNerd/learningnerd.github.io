Infoplease runs a daily word quiz, and the other day they asked <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/wordoftheday?month=Dec&day=07">this question</a>:

<blockquote>
The effluvium put forth by the menacing volcano most likely left people doing which of the following?
<ul>
a.) running for their lives

b.) wrinkling their noses

c.) grabbing their cameras
</ul>
</blockquote>

I imagine they'd be doing all three at the same time, but the answer is B.

<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&q=effluvium">Effluvium</a></em> is a noun with a couple definitions:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>A usually invisible emanation or exhalation, as of vapor or gas.</li>

	<li>A byproduct or residue; waste.</li>

	<li>The odorous fumes given off by waste or decaying matter.</li>

	<li>An impalpable emanation; an aura.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=effluence">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, the word comes from Latin <em>ex-</em> "out" and <em>fluere</em> "to flow", as in <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/effluent">effluent</a></em> and <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&q=effluence">effluence</a></em>, which are both related to "flowing out" and pollution.

Example sentence: The volcano's effluent lava brought with it an effluence of effluvium.

<em>Effluvium</em> isn't a common word, but it can create strong imagery: "Billboards are the effluvium of commerce, just like manure is the effluvium of hog farming." (Quote from <a href="http://littleurbanity.blogspot.com/2004/11/visual-effluvium.html">A Little Urbanity: visual effluvium</a>.) You could replace <em>effluvium</em> with <em>byproduct</em>, but  <em>effluvium</em> engages your senses. Manure and billboards are more than just byproducts; they <em>stink</em>.
