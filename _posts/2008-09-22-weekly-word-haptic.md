The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/haptic">haptic</a></em> means "of or relating to the sense of touch; tactile". This must be another rare one, because my spell-checker doesn't believe it's a word!

It comes from Greek <em>haptesthai</em>, meaning "to touch". According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Sep.04.2008" title="Haptic - Word of the Day">Merriam-Webster</a>, <em>haptic</em> was first "a medical synonym for tactile", but it was later used in psychology to refer to "individuals whose perception supposedly depended primarily on touch rather than sight".

Today, haptics refers to the science of touch -- fascinating stuff there!

I bet that <em>haptic</em> will be a much more common word in the future.
