<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/damask">Damask</a></em> is a type of "rich patterned fabric", and it can also refer to "the pink color of the damask rose". The word <em>damask</em> is also an adjective ("resembling damask") and a verb ("to decorate or weave with rich patterns").

The cloth was named after the Syrian city <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/artsandculture/2824926/Damascus-Syria-Road-to-enchantment.html" title="An article about visiting the city Damascus">Damascus</a>, "famous in medieval times for steel and silk" (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=damask" title="Damask - Online Etymology Dictionary">OED</a>). The word seems like it lends itself to more general uses -- maybe to describe anything richly decorated. But a search for <em>damask</em> on Google News shows that it's almost always used to refer to that type of fabric.
