**Today I learned:**

*   (More of a realization) The [Learn to Code LA meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/LearnToCodeLA/) seriously needs more photos! I better start using my good camera more often.
*   I can make _so many_ sketches in just 25 minutes! I need to do this more often, because I can work through ideas so much faster this way!

**Tasks completed:**

*   Spent 25 minutes sketching ideas for the meetup website.

**Tasks _not_ completed:**

*   Despite setting this as a goal for today, I didn&#39;t implement any of the features for the website or answer any of my own questions yet. (I&#39;m hoping to work on that tonight if I have time.) My excuse: I had a terrible headache this morning.

**Questions:**

*   How do I make a full-width header image with text on top of it?
*   How do I make a responsive navigation menu (ideally without any JavaScript)?
*   How do I make a simple grid-based layout?
*   How do I properly implement a &quot;vertical rhythm&quot; for web typography?
*   How do I determine which fonts to use and which ones look good together?
*   How do I decide on a color scheme for the website?

**Obstacles:** Third day in a row I&#39;ve had a headache, which I now think might be eyestrain. Argh! Maybe I finally need glasses.

**Solutions to try next:** Take more frequent breaks to look away from the screen. (And make an appointment for an eye exam.)

**Follow-up on yesterday&#39;s problem and solution: ** Writing down a couple specific goals last night defnitely made it easier to start working this morning. I also had a little more caffeine, which helped for a little while. But my morning was still derailed by this awful headache!

**Goals for tomorrow:**

*   Implement the full-width header image with the title, tagline/description, and a big, beautiful &quot;Join Us!&quot; button.
*   Take notes on all the HTML/CSS stuff I learn in the process.
*   If I finish that, spend some more time learning about and practicing my CSS positioning skills.
