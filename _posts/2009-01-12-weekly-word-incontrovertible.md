Here's a long adjective with a short definition: <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/incontrovertible">incontrovertible</a></em> means "not open to question", "indisputable", "impossible to deny", or, phrased another way, "necessarily or demonstrably true". I prefer any of those definitions over "not controvertible". Why does Dictionary.com even bother including that? :roll:

Anyway, as you can probably guess, this word is related to <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=controversy" title="Online Etymology Dictionary - Controversy">controversy</a></em>, which comes from Latin <em>contra-</em>, meaning "against", and <em>versus</em>, meaning "to turn". And apparently there's even a verb <em>controvert</em>, meaning "to argue against". I've never seen it before, but a quick search reveals that it does show up in recent news articles.

I thought I'd come up with a clever little sentence that uses all these similar words together, but others already have, as in "controvert the incontrovertible". I liked this phrase from somebody's <a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/ope/archive/0102/0086.html">academic retort</a> (about I don't know what): "I say that the evidence was incontrovertible because you did not try to controvert it."
