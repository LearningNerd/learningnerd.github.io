To <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lucubrate">lucubrate</a> is "to write learnedly" or "to work, write, or study laboriously, esp. at night".

Once I start college, I'll be lucubrating my brains out! I just wish this word was more common, because I'd love to find an excuse to use it. Unfortunately, it's so rarely used that I can't even find any decent example sentences.

It comes from the Latin word <em>lucubrare</em>, meaning "to work at night by lamplight", according to the American Heritage Dictionary.
