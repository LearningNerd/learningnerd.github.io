title: 'My plan to kill the "math person" myth (Math Immersion Month Day 2)'
category: math
---

After realizing [yesterday]({% post_url 2015-12-01-math-day-1 %}) that my assumptions about myself were *completely* wrong, I spent some time learning about just how destructive the "math person" myth can be, and I created version 1 of my plan to squash my own "not a math person" myth once and for all.

## My goals for this month
- Publilsh a video every day to share my learning process
- Publish a blog post every day to serve as a brain dump of all my ideas and questions and to compile a list of helpful resources
- Improve my computational skills (starting with arithmetic)
- Track my progress by taking pre- and post-tests
- Learn more about real math -- the more creative, abstract mathematics!
- Interview at least three mathematicians or people who enjoy math
- Interview a couple people who *don't* like math
- Explore connections between math and my other interests (like language, music, history, art, psychology, etc)
- Make a couple small creative projects to explore mathematical concepts -- maybe a small programming project or just some silly drawings!
- Read math books, listen to math podcasts, watch math videos -- really immerse myself in this fascinating new world!
- Track how much time I'm spending on all of this!

## Schedule version 1
- **2 hours** on math practice problems
- **2 hours** reading about math more generally
- **2 hours** making my daily video
- **2 hours** on my other projects, like a small freelance web development job and running Learn to Code LA, the meetup group I started earlier this year

If I feel like working more than 8 hours, then I will; otherwise, I'll try to reserve time for working on my other goals like socializing and making more friends in meatspace.
