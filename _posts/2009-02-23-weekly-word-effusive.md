The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/effusive">effusive</a></em> means "overflowing", "extravagantly demonstrative", or "unrestrained or excessive in emotional expression". The verb form <em>to effuse</em> means "to pour out" or "to radiate".

Wikipedia, of course, has a page about <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion">effusion</a>. In chemistry, it's "the process where individual molecules flow through a hole without collisions between molecules" (think of a deflating balloon).

The most common use of <em>effusive</em> would probably be to describe "effusive praise", either from expert critics or from effusive fanboys. The word also comes up a lot in articles about the Academy Awards, what with all those gushy actors sobbing over their Oscars.
