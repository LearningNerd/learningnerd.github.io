title: "The Difference Between Plot and Story"

When looking at some sites about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_%28narrative%29">plot</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story">story</a>, I ran across this quote (or misquote?) a few times:

<blockquote>The king died and then the queen died.

The king died and then the queen died of grief.</blockquote>

The first sentence is a story, while the second is a plot. Apparently this example comes from E.M. Forster's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aspects-Novel-E-M-Forster/dp/0156091801">Aspects of the Novel</a></em>. According to <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/books-writers-aspects-novel-emforster.html" title="Books for Writers - Aspects of the Novel by E.M. Forster">this review</a>, the book is 175 pages of must-read material!

Anyway, I do like that example of his. I also like <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~cstroupe/ideas/plotstory.html" title="Plot vs Story - Craig Stroupe">this explanation</a>:

<blockquote>A story is a series of events recorded in their chronological order.

A plot is a series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance.</blockquote>

The way I think of it, a plain story is like history: boring. ;) But a plot is someone's <em>telling</em> of the story. It may be biased or inaccurate, but it's more interesting! Many works of fiction are based on the same basic stories or actual events. Is there even such a thing as a truly original story? I doubt it.

I'm sure I'm not the only one that gets frustrated when trying to come up with an original story. Everything's been done before! I need to constantly remind myself that the originality is all in the plot, the telling of the story.
