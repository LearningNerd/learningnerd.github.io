The <a href="http://www.spellingbee.com/">2009 Scripps National Spelling Bee</a> is this week, and the website lists two of the spellers' favorite words: <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humuhumunukunukuapuaa">humuhumunukunukuapuaa</a></em> ("a small Hawaiian triggerfish") and <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weissnichtwo">Weissnichtwo</a></em>, which is "an indefinite, unknown, or imaginary place". I don't even know how to pronounce it, never mind spell it!

This obscure German word (meaning "know not where") was made up by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle. <em>Weissnichtwo</em> was the name of a fictional city in the book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartor_Resartus">Sartor Resartus</a></em>, Carlyle's major work. You'll have to read the book (or at least the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartor_Resartus#Weissnichtwo" title="Weissnichtwo">Wikipedia entry</a>) to figure out the reason behind the name.

By the way, I'm actually very familiar with that other word, <em>humuhumunukunukuapuaa</em>. We had one in our fish tank when I was little. It was a cute, tiny little thing; as they say, "the name is longer than the fish" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_Triggerfish">Wikipedia</a>). But wow, did that fish have teeth! Ever since then, those painful nips at my fingertips are what I remember best when I think about the state fish of Hawaii.
