I found this word from the wonderful <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/index.html">A.Word.A.Day</a> site. Also spelled <em>maukin</em> or <em>mawkin</em>, <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/malkin">malkin</a></em> is a noun with a number of different meanings:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>an untidy woman; slattern.</li>
	<li>a scarecrow, ragged puppet, or grotesque effigy.</li>
	<li>a mop, esp. one made from a bundle of rags and used to clean out a baker's oven.</li>
	<li>a cat.</li>
	<li>a hare.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Here's what the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=malkin">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> has to share:

<blockquote>"a slattern, woman of the lower classes," c.1275, from fem. proper name <em>Malkyn</em>, a dim. of <em>Mault</em> "Maud" (see <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Matilda">Matilda</a>). Also attested from c.1207 as the proper name of a female specter. Sense of "untidy woman" led to meaning "mop, bundle of rags on a stick" (used to clean ovens, artillery pieces, etc.), c.1400. Attested as the name of a cat since 1673; used in Scotland and northern England as the name of a hare (1724).
</blockquote>

As for the word <em><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Matilda">Matilda</a></em>:

<blockquote>
fem. proper name, from Fr. <em>Mathilde</em>, of Gmc. origin, lit. "mighty in battle," cf. O.H.G. <em>Mahthilda</em>, from <em>mahti</em> "might, power" + <em>hildi</em> "battle."
</blockquote>

Interesting. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkin" title="Malkin">Wikipedia</a> points out a few unlucky souls whose last names are Malkin, like political blogger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a>. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I know I wouldn't want that to be <em>my</em> last name. ;)
