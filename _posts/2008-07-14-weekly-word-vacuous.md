<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vacuous">Vacuous</a></em> is an adjective meaning "without contents; empty". Its more specific meanings include "devoid of meaning", "devoid of expression", "lacking in ideas or intelligence", or "idle".

It comes from the Latin word <em>vacuus</em>, meaning "empty, void, free". So yes, as you already know, it's related to the word <em>vacuum</em>. But did you know that it's also related to the word <em>vain</em> through the Latin word <em>vacare</em>, meaning "to be empty"? Yup.

Well, turns out there aren't really any other interesting facts about <em>vacuous</em> -- not that it's a vacuous word, though. If you want to get a headache, just read Wikipedia's article on the abstract concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a>.
