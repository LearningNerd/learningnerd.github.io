<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/savoir-faire">Savoir-faire</a></em> is "tact" or "knowledge of just what to do in any situation". It comes from French (duh!), from the words <em>savoir</em>, meaning "to know how", and <em>faire</em>, "to do".

Writers just love to use expressions from other languages; it makes their writing sound more worldly. So it's not surprising that <em>savoir-faire</em> shows up in some news articles, like here:

<blockquote>
"The mustachioed Mason set the bar for cinema savoir-faire in the films 'It Happened One Night' and 'Gone With the Wind'..." -- referring to Clark Gable, from an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/image/la-ig-masonside18-2008may18,0,6439965.story" title="Notable Masons were fashion trendsetters">LA Times article</a>.
</blockquote>

Other phrases I found were "poker-faced savoir faire", "savoir faire in fragrance", and "the irreverent savoir faire of James Bond". Just one of the many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_phrases">French phrases</a> that are fun to throw around. Some other French words I've learned include: <a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-recherche">recherche</a>, <a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-ennui">ennui</a>, <a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-bricolage">bricolage</a>, and <a href="http://learningnerd.com/weekly-word-flaneur">flaneur</a>.
