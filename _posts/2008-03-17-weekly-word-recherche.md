The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/recherche">recherche</a></em> means "rare", "exotic", "of studied refinement or elegance", or "pretentious". As you may have guessed, this word comes from French. It's pronounced "ruh-sher-shay" (listen to the pronunciation at <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?recher01.wav=recherche" title="Pronunciation of Recherche">Merriam-Webster</a>).

<em>Recherche</em> is related to the less extravagant word <em>research</em> via the Old French word <em>recercher</em>, meaning "to seek out". So something that's <em>recherche</em> has been "sought out with care".

The Online Etymology Dictionary mentions that the word was used "to denote obscure excellence", often describing 19th century "food, styles, etc." I imagine this word would be a favorite among art film critics -- or at least it'd be my favorite word to describe them! ;) Nah, just some of them.
