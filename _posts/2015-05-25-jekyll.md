title: Learning About Jekyll

I can't seem to stop reading about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and other [static site generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) (all 395 of them)!

**Quick personal check-in:** This past week, I've spent most of my morning free time either oversleeping or working on something other than what I said I would work on (I'm supposed to be working on my [Learn to Code LA meetup website](http://learntocodela.org)). Maybe the problem is that I don't see a use for the meetup website just yet. And meanwhile, I'm frustrated with how *this* website is currently set up! I think that's why the only thing I've been excited about recently was the idea of using some of Jekyll's more advanced features. So I'm going to try a different strategy now and just roll with it. Let's see if I make any more progress this week if I let curiosity be my guide.

And here are a couple Jekyll projects that have inspired me:

- [**The Open Data Handbook**](http://opendatahandbook.org/) -- a beautiful Jekyll site that features a nice [resource library](http://opendatahandbook.org/resources/) and invites readers to [contribute over GitHub](http://opendatahandbook.org/contribute/)!
- [**Tracking Everything I Read Online**](https://clifff.com/2014/08/17/tracking-everything-i-read-online/) by Cliff Reeder -- an interesting use of Jekyll data files and some other coding magic!

The next time I can sit down and work on stuff, I want to see how I can use some of Jekyll's more advanced features to make this a better learning blog. I also have a lot of ideas for using Jekyll in my day job!
