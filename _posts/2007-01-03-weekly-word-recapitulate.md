<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/recapitulate">Recapitulate</a> - <em>v. to review by a brief summary, as at the end of a speech or discussion; summarize.</em>

"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny," said Ernst Haeckel, who came up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory">Recapitulation Theory</a>. Biology aside, it looks like that theory created a new, more specific definition of the word <em>recapitulate</em>: "<em>Biology.</em> (of an organism) to repeat (ancestral evolutionary stages) in its development."

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=recapitulation">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, <em>recapitulate</em> can be traced back to Latin <em>recapitulare</em>, from <em>re-</em> "again" and <em>capitulum</em> "main part".
