The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/echt">echt</a></em> means "real; authentic; genuine". Sounds German, doesn't it? Because it's a real, authentic, genuine German word! It comes from Middle Low German <em>echte</em>, related to Old High German <em>eohaft</em>, meaning "customary".

According to the American Heritage Dictionary, <em>echt</em> can also be used as an adverb to mean "really" or "genuinely", though the only examples I've found use it as an adjective. I discovered the word at <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/index.html">A.Word.A.Day</a>, which also provides an example sentence taken from an article in The Ithaca Journal: "...Pete Rush has provided echt polyester '70s garb..."

English definitely borrows more French words than German words, but I think the German words are just as fun to say -- or would it be more accurate to say they're just as fun to mispronounce?
