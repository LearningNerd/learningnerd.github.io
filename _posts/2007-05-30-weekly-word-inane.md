<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inane">Inane</a></em>, as a noun, means "something that is empty or void, esp. the void of infinite space." Similarly, the adjective form means "empty; void" or "lacking sense, significance, or ideas; silly".

It comes from Latin "<em>inanitatem</em> 'emptiness,' from <em>inanis</em> 'empty, void, worthless, useless'", according to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=inane">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>.

I like this word for some reason -- maybe because it sounds like <em>insane</em>. Or maybe I just like its comically snobbish tone: "Oh, stop your inane ramblings already!"
