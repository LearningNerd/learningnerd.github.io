title: A Fresh Stylesheet

I settled on my next step for the [Learn to Code LA](http://learntocodela.org) meetup website: the stylesheet. I'm just going to pretend that the content is done (even though it isn't) and start making the website, because that's the part I need to practice.

**My goal for today:** start creating the website and compile a list of all the things I don't know about making stylesheets.

First, I deleted all the CSS from the stylesheet to start with a blank slate:

Ugly, isn't it? It still has some styles applied to it though, because every web browser has some default CSS. Actually, this is a topic I really want to learn more about: the guts of the web browser and the nitty gritty details of how CSS is implemented. But that's for another day.

I remember reading about CSS resets a few years ago, back when I dabbled in freelance web design a tiny bit. The general idea is to undo all the browser-specific defaults so your design will be consistent across all web browsers. Read [The History of CSS Resets](http://sixrevisions.com/css/the-history-of-css-resets/) for more than you ever wanted to know about the topic. (OK, I'll be honest, I spent *way* too much time reading about CSS resets today because I was just curious about all the pedantic details and how it's changed over the last few years.)

Today, [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is also super popular; instead of resetting all the CSS, it preserves browser defaults and makes them consistent.

Oh wow, I keep getting sidetracked and reading about CSS instead of *writing* any CSS of my own! I should probably follow along with some tutorial just to keep myself on track, like maybe this [guide to creating a layout from scratch](http://www.subcide.com/articles/creating-a-css-layout-from-scratch/) -- oh, but it's from 2006! In web dev years, that's ancient!

Then I just wasted even more time searching for good tutorials without actually reading any of them. Oops. And somehow I ended up reading more about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and some of its more advanced features, which I really want an excuse to use! I'm not sure I can keep myself from falling down that rabbit hole.
