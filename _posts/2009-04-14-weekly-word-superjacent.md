This word made me laugh because it sounds like it means "something that is extremely jacent." Unfortunately, <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/superjacent">superjacent</a></em> isn't nearly that interesting; it just means "lying above", like <em>adjacent</em> means "lying next to".

Here's what is interesting, though: <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jacent">jacent</a></em> is actually a word by itself. Weird, huh? It means "lying at length", as in "the jacent posture." It comes from the Latin word <em>jacere</em>, which means "to lie" or "rest".

So, just slap on a random prefix like <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ad-">ad-</a></em> or <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/super-">super-</a></em> and you have a new word! <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Apr.10.2009" title="Superjacent">Merriam-Webster</a> also mentions the words <em>subjacent</em>, "lying below", and <em>circumjacent</em>, "surrounding". I also discovered <em>interjacent</em>, "between or among others".

But there's no such thing as transjacent, prejacent, postjacent, cojacent, or nonjacent (though <em>nonadjacent</em> is actually a word). Can you think of any others?
