Just a few notes from working on my mob coding app:

**Milestones:**

  - Finally started using the [Dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to manage local environment variables.

  - Switched to handling GitHub authentication with my own server and learned how to make a new route that makes a POST request from Node and redirects the user back to the homepage with their GitHub access token. Woohoo!

  - Set up production version with Heroku environment variables, no more hard-coded URLs or client ID (for now, just using an AJAX request to get the client ID from the server).

  - Did a second user test, this time virtually, with [this fun practice problem from r/DailyProgrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5e4mde/20161121_challenge_293_easy_defusing_the_bomb/)! Got some good feedback and identified some more bugs.


**Questions:**

  - How should I go about generating an "unguessable string" for the `state` parameter for GitHub authentication?

  - What's the simplest way to pass a variable from my server to my clients? Do I have to stop using that nifty Express static file server function? Do I need to use a templating system? Is it stupid to use AJAX to request it from the server? (For now, I'm just using an AJAX request.)

  - What's the simplest way to make a POST request from my NodeJS server? (**Answered:** Just use http.request method, woohoo!)


**Some research on the GitHub API:**

  - https://developer.github.com/guides/getting-started/
  - https://developer.github.com/v3/git/commits/#create-a-commit
  - https://mdswanson.com/blog/2011/07/23/digging-around-the-github-api-take-2.html
  - http://github-tools.github.io/github/
  - http://www.nolim1t.co/2017/03/08/uploading-to-github-through-the-API.html
  - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects
  - http://www.levibotelho.com/development/commit-a-file-with-the-github-api  

**Tangent:** What a cool idea for Jekyll blogs! https://github.com/benbalter/jekyllbot


**Next steps:** (based on user test feedback)

  - Make the code editor take up as much screen real estate as possible!

  - Add some way to choose a programming challenge and load in its instructions!

  - Display programming challenge instructions separately from the code, so players can read it more easily while others are typing.

  - Add some sort of notification system to alert players when it's their turn.

  - Fix bug where turn changes before the timer is up!

  - Find out why my app crashed or why it kicked out all the clients after a while. Try deploying via Cloud9 instead, see if that makes any difference, and check the logs.
