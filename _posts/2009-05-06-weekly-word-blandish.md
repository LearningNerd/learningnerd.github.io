No, <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blandish">blandish</a></em> doesn't only mean "sort of bland". It's also a verb that means "to coax or influence by gentle flattery".

But it is related to <em>bland</em>, because both words come from Latin <em>blandus</em>, meaning "mild" or "smooth". So, even though <em>bland</em> usually refers to something dull or flavorless, it can also mean "tranquil", "soothing", "gentle", or "agreeable". I assume that those more positive meanings are from a long time ago, because I've never heard anyone use <em>bland</em> in a good way. Have you?

Meanwhile, the word <em>blandish</em> doesn't seem to exist at all! I couldn't find any real-world example sentences -- only Dictionary.com's example: "They blandished the guard into letting them through the gate."

I guess there's no real need for the word <em>blandish</em>, since its synonyms <em>coax</em> and <em>cajole</em> do the job just fine. But hey, for all you poets out there, it's one more rhyme for <em>brandish</em>.
