To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fustigate">fustigate</a></em> means "to beat with a club" or "to criticize harshly". It derives from the Latin word <em>fustis</em>, meaning "club", and <em>agere</em>, meaning "to do".

Unfortunately, <em>fustigate</em> has always been a rare word. <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-fus1.htm" title="Fustigate">World Wide Words</a> found that even back in 1896, the Oxford English Dictionary described it as "humorously pedantic".

But <em>fustigate</em> seems to have made a comeback. Some word-lovers have humorously used it in such phrases as "go fustigate yourself". Personally, I'm bored of our overused profanities, so I'm all for replacing them with rare literary words! Did you know that some <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120401286.html" title="In French-Speaking Canada, the Sacred Is Also Profane">French-speaking Canadians</a> use "commonplace Catholic terms" as swear words?
