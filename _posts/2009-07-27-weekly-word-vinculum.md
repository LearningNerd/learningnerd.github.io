This word came up for me recently in both a math book and in some random <em>Star Trek</em> trivia. A <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vinculum">vinculum</a></em> is "a bond signifying union or unity".

As a term used in mathematical notation, it refers to "a horizontal line placed above multiple quantities to indicate that they form a unit" (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Vinculum.html" title="Vinculum">Wolfram MathWorld</a>).

And in the world of <em>Star Trek</em>, the vinculum is a processing device in the core of Borg vessels that connects the minds of all the drones (<a href="http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Vinculum" title="Vinculum">Memory Beta Star Trek Wiki</a>). Brainwashed drones all working in unison? Yup, <em>vinculum</em> is a perfect name for a device that creates a bond like that.
