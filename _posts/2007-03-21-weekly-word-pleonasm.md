A <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pleonasm">pleonasm</a> is "a redundant word or expression", like "free gift" or "true fact". Wikipedia's article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleonasm">Pleonasm</a> has a lot more information on redundancy in language, if you're interested.

According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pleonasm">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, <em>pleonasm</em> comes from Greek <em>pleonasein</em>, meaning "to be more than enough," which comes from <em>pleon</em> "more", which is related to <em>poly-</em>, meaning "many" or "much".

Anyway, next time someone offers me a "free gift", I'll have to point out their redundant pleonasm.
