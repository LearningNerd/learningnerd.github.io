A <em>foppotee</em> is a simple-minded person. I found this one on <a href="http://www.savethewords.org/">Save the Words</a>, and according to The Phrontistery's list of <a href="http://phrontistery.info/clw2.html">lost words</a>, <em>foppotee</em> was used in 1663 and is now extinct.

Or is it? A few people around the internet have used it. Somebody even named their blog "<a href="http://foppotee.wordpress.com/">Foppotee is a word</a>
