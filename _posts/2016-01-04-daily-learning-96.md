Today I taught the first [Learn to Code LA](http://learntocodela.org) workshop of the year, and as we approach our one-year anniversary (with over 2000 members!), I reflect on how I feel about it at the moment. I may have come across as a bit more pessimistic than I really feel, probably just because I was *really* tired when I recorded this.
