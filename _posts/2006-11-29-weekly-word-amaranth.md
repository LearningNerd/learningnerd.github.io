It's a poetic word with a rich background. Just as the rose is a symbol of love, the amaranth is a symbol of immortality. See Wikipedia's section on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth#Myth.2C_legend_and_poetry">Myth, Legend and Poetry</a> of the amaranth for some literary examples.

<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000726">The Mavens' Word of the Day</a> has an interesting article on the history of <em>amaranth</em>:

<blockquote>English <em>amaranth</em>, which first appeared in the 16th century, came from Latin <em>amarantus</em>, meaning not just 'flower', but 'an unfading flower'. The Greek word from which Latin <em>amarantus</em> derived is <em>amarantos</em> which is formed from the prefix <em>a-</em> meaning 'not' (called the "alpha privative") plus <em>marainein</em> meaning 'to wither or decay'. The Indo-European root of this word, <em>mer-</em> meaning 'to die', is also the source of such words as "mortal, murder," and "mortgage."</blockquote>

And for all of you health-food addicts, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth_grain">amaranth grain</a> is apparently very healthy. :P Yum!
