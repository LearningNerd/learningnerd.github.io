Sentences are categorized in two ways: by structure and by purpose.
<h2>Types of Sentences by Structure</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_sentence"><strong>Simple Sentence</strong></a> - "<u>I love chocolate</u>." One <a href="http://learningnerd.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/english-grammar-types-of-clauses/" title="Types of Clauses">independent clause</a> (underlined).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_sentence_%28linguistics%29"><strong>Compound Sentence</strong></a> - "<u>I love chocolate</u>, and <u>I love eating chocolate</u>." Two or more independent clauses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_sentence"><strong>Complex Sentence</strong></a> - "<u>I love chocolate</u> <em>because it's decadent</em>." One independent clause and one or more <a href="http://learningnerd.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/english-grammar-types-of-clauses/" title="Types of Clauses">dependent clauses</a> (italicized). Note: according to Wikipedia, a sentence like "The dog chewed up the shoes that I just bought" is a simple sentence, not a complex sentence, because the <a href="http://learningnerd.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/english-grammar-types-of-clauses/" title="Types of Clauses">relative clause</a> "<em>that I just bought</em>" simply modifies the noun without performing any other function. I'm not sure how accurate this is, however.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex-compound_sentence"><strong>Complex-Compound Sentence</strong></a> - "<u>I love chocolate</u> <em>because it's decadent</em>, and <u>I love eating chocolate</u> <em>because it's delicious</em>." Two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.</li>
</ul>
Those four categories apply to normal, grammatical sentences. However, some of our most common expressions are sentences that don't follow the rules -- see <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_%28linguistics%29#Major_and_minor_sentences">Major and Minor Sentences</a>.

Note: obsessive syntacticians (is there any other kind?) have also named more specific types of sentences, which I'll address when I start learning about the finer points of writing style.
<h2>Types of Sentences by Purpose</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.arts.uottawa.ca/writcent/hypergrammar/sntpurps.html#sntdecl" title="The Purpose of a Sentence - The Declarative Sentence"><strong>Declarative Sentence</strong></a> - "I love chocolate." Used to make a simple statement. Most sentences are declarative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.arts.uottawa.ca/writcent/hypergrammar/sntpurps.html#sntinter" title="The Purpose of a Sentence - The Interrogative Sentence"><strong>Interrogative Sentence</strong></a> - "Do you love chocolate?" Used to ask a question. See also <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question">Rhetorical Question</a>. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.arts.uottawa.ca/writcent/hypergrammar/sntpurps.html#sntexcl" title="The Purpose of a Sentence - The Exclamatory Sentence"><strong>Exclamatory Sentence</strong></a> - "I need chocolate!" Used for emphasis and emotion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.arts.uottawa.ca/writcent/hypergrammar/sntpurps.html#sntimpr" title="The Purpose of a Sentence - The Imperative Sentence"><strong>Imperative Sentence</strong></a> - "Please buy me some chocolate." Used for commands, with the pronoun <em>you</em> always implied.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence"><strong>Conditional Sentence</strong></a> - "If I had a billion dollars, I would buy a castle made of chocolate." Used to express what one would do if a condition were met. There are several types of conditional sentences: the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence#Present_General">present general</a> (or zero condition), the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence#Future_More-Vivid">future more-vivid</a> (or first condition), the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence#Future_Less-Vivid">future less-vivid</a> (or second condition), the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence#Present_Contrafactual">present contrafactual</a> (also sometimes called the second condition), and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence#Past_Contrafactual">past contrafactual</a> (or third condition).</li>
</ul>
