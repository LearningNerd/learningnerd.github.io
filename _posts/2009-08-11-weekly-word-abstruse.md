The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abstruse">abstruse</a></em> means "hard to understand".

Some examples found on <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> include "America's abstruse tax code", "abstruse terms and conditions", and "abstruse mathematics". The abstruse sign pictured on the left is another prime example of something that's hard to understand.

Interestingly, <em>abstruse</em> and <em>extrude</em> both share a Latin root: <em>trudere</em>, which means "to thrust" or "to push". So <em>abstruse</em> literally means "to thrust away", while <em>extrude</em> means "to thrust out". The word <em>extrude</em> matches its literal Latin meaning perfectly, but <em>abstruse</em> doesn't. How does "thrust away" mean "hard to understand"? Well, it turns out that <em>abstruse</em> has a second, obsolete meaning: "hidden". I imagine an old book pushed under the bed, hidden from sight.
