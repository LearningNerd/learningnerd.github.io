Maybe I'm the only person who didn't already know this, but <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/simoleon">simoleons</a></em>, the currency from <em>The Sims</em> series of video games, is actually a slang term for dollars!

Its origin is listed as unknown on every etymology site I could find. All anyone seems to know is that it's an Americanism from around the year 1900. Do people still use this term? Or did I just spend so much time playing <em>The Sims</em> that I didn't get out of the house enough to hear the word <em>simoleon</em> in real life?
