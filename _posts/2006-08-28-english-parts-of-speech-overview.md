The parts of speech determine how words interact with each other, organizing words based on their uses and meanings. For a detailed overview, see the entry for <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_category">Lexical Category on Wikipedia</a>.

I remember learning the basics in school, but I can’t remember every detail. For example, what exactly is a preposition (as opposed to a conjunction)? What part of speech does “therefore” belong to? So, without getting <em>too</em> much into linguistics (that's for another post), I'm going to review the eight traditional parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.
