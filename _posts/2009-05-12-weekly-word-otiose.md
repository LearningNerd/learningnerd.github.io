The adjective <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/otiose">otiose</a></em> means "useless", "ineffective", or "being at leisure". It comes straight from that Latin word <em>otiosus</em>, "having leisure or ease, not busy".

<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?May.09.2009" title="Otiose - Word of the Day">Merriam-Webster</a> points out:

<blockquote>"There is also the noun form "otiosity," which predates "otiose" by approximately three centuries. That noun is rarely found in writing today, but it makes an appearance on the occasional spelling bee word list."</blockquote>

They're right; I can't find any example sentences for <em>otiosity</em>. But <em>otiose</em> shows up a few times on Google News, usually to mean "useless". For example: "I will not be drawn into the miasma of premature analysis and debate, an otiose exercise" (<a href="http://www.thenorthwestern.com/article/20090510/OSH06/905100412" rel="nofollow">David Hayford</a>). Two vocab words in one sentence! What a deal! I'll save <em>miasma</em> for next week. :)
