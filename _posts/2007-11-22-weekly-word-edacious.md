Like <em>ravenous</em>, <em>rapacious</em>, and <em>voracious</em>, the word <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/edacious">edacious</a></em> relates to having a big appetite. It's defined as "devouring", "consuming", "greedy", or "craving food in great quantities". Sounds like somebody I know. ;)

The noun form of <em>edacious</em> is <em>edacity</em>, just like its cousins <em>rapacity</em> and <em>voracity</em>.

And I found some interesting history on <em>edacious</em> at <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-eda1.htm">World Wide Words</a>:

<blockquote>
...it comes from the Latin verb <em>edere</em>, to eat. [...] It never really caught on and is now almost extinct, perhaps because <em>voracious</em> is a better established and more vigorous-sounding alternative. The Roman writer Ovid created a maxim in his <em>Metamorphoses</em>: "Tempus edax rerum", time devours everything. As a result, in its rare appearances the word is most likely to be linked with time. Thomas Carlyle used it in this way when he referred to events "swallowed in the depths of edacious time".
</blockquote>

So <em>voracious</em> might be better than <em>edacious</em> to describe my anticipation of Thanksgiving dinner (happy turkey day!), but I still like this new word. You never know when a reference to Ovid might come in handy.
