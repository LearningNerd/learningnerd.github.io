They have a word for everything, don't they? This one made me laugh. :lol: <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/callipygian">Callipygian</a></em> is an adjective that means "having well-shaped buttocks."

The word comes from a type of statue of Aphrodite called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Kallipygos">Venus Kallipygos</a>. According to the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=callipygian">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, the Greek word <em>kallipygos</em> is a combination of "<em>kallos</em> 'beauty' + <em>pyge</em> 'rump, buttocks.'"

When looking for an example sentence, I found <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21105424-5001986,00.html" title="The floodgates have been jammed open">an article</a> in <em>The Australian</em> with a funny conclusion:

<blockquote>As for badonkadonk, an American coinage to describe curvaceous female buttocks (to do with the sound said buttocks might make when in motion), I just can't see it replacing the perfectly formed callipygian. Those ancient Greeks left more than philosophical treatises to posteriority.</blockquote>

I have to agree. I just love sophisticated-sounding words with not-particularly-sophisticated meanings. And that's why you should always look up the words you aren't familiar with: you might have a good laugh!
