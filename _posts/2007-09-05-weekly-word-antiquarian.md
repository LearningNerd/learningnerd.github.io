My mom's an <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antiquarian">antiquarian</a></em> (or an <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antiquary">antiquary</a></em>): "One who studies, collects, or deals in antiquities." She sells antiques for a living, specializing in vintage purses. But this guy proves that collecting antiques can be a very manly hobby, too:

The word <em>antiquarian</em> has a more specific meaning as well, though. As an adjective, it not only means "relating to antiques", but also "dealing in or having to do with old or rare books" -- as in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquarian_book_trade_in_the_United_States">Antiquarian book trade</a>. That's one thing I definitely know nothing about; I'm more of a pack rat than an antiquarian.
