Now I can't back out of this! I officially announced my programming bootcamp experiment. Will anyone sign up?! Turns out, the answer is yes! In this personal video blog, I reflect on what I've learned about the power of vulnerability and how I fixed up the application form for this pilot program thanks to help from a couple friends.

Special shout out to my friends [Paul Lumsdaine](https://twitter.com/madebypaul) and [Samantha](https://twitter.com/dvlprsam) (who also has a [cool YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1rKwIl2Dr_w7BxpSnzAyQ), woot!) -- thank you both for sharing such detailed and thoughtful feedback on my first draft!

If I have time tonight, I'll add some more notes here summarizing what's new in this crazy journey!
