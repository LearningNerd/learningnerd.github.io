Yup, <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/frigorific">frigorific</a></em> really is a word. It means "causing or producing cold".

An article from <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-fri1.htm" title="Frigorific">World Wide Words</a> reports that "the most common appearance of frigorific is in that characteristically American phenomenon, the spelling bee." Aside from that, this rare word is usually reserved for scientific jargon; for example, Wikipedia has an entry about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigorific_mixture">frigorific mixtures</a>, combinations of "chemicals that achieve an equilibrium temperature independent of the temperature that the two chemicals started at."

But when I see the word, I keep thinking it says <em>fridge</em>-orific. Sounds more like a cheesy exclamation about how terrific a refrigerator is. By the way, the words <em>frigorific</em> and <em>refrigerator</em> both come from the Latin root <em>frigus</em>, meaning (yes, you guessed it!) cold.
