If you're into crossword puzzles, you better know this word! A <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cruciverbalist">cruciverbalist</a> is "a designer or aficionado of crossword puzzles". According to <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-cru1.htm" title="Cruciverbalist">World Wide Words</a>, "there is also cruciverbalism, for the art of crossword compilation or crossword fandom generally, but that is much rarer."

Somebody (probably a cruciverbalist himself) translated <em>crossword</em> into Latin: <em>cruc-</em> meaning "cross" and <em>verbum</em> meaning "word". Put them together and you get this mouthful of a word, cruciverbalist.

Since most crossword lovers are also word lovers, and most word lovers know some Latin, the creation of this word makes total sense. In fact, I'd be surprised if there <em>wasn't</em> a word for "someone who likes crossword puzzles"!
