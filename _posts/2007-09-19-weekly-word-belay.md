Arr, it be <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>! To celebrate this fine event, I learned a new piratical word: to <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/belay">belay</a></em>. It's often used as a command meaning "to stop", as in "Belay that landlubber's talk!" Or it can mean "to ignore (an announcement, order, etc.)", as in "Yarr, belay that order! I need me rum!"

More technically, to <em>belay</em> also means "to fasten (a rope) by winding around a pin or short rod inserted in a holder so that both ends of the rod are clear." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belaying">Belaying</a> is also a term used in climbing, meaning "to secure (a rope) by attaching to a person or to an object offering stable support."

Anyway, for those who plan to celebrate today, I thought you might enjoy this educational video on how to talk like a pirate:

Don't laugh! Drinking rum really does help with achieving the proper accent. ;)
