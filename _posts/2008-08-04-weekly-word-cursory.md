<em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cursory">Cursory</a></em> is an adjective meaning "going rapidly over something, without noticing details; hasty; superficial".

I've come across this word many times before, but I never bothered to look up its full definition. Apparently it comes from the Latin word <em>cursor</em>. Sound familiar? It's that little arrow on your computer screen, showing you where you're pointing the mouse. Well, the Latin word <em>cursor</em> means "runner".

I never made a connection between <em>cursory</em> and <em>cursor</em>, despite how similar they sound. Have you?
