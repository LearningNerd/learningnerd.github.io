To <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/impute">impute</a></em> means "to attribute or ascribe". Unlike a lot of my previous words, this one isn't unusual or obscure in any way. It comes from Latin <em>imputare</em>, a combination of <em>in-</em>, meaning "upon", and <em>putare</em>, meaning "reckon, clear up, trim, prune, settle" (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=impute" title="Online Etymology Dictionary - impute">OED</a>). Related words include <em>dispute</em>, <em>compute</em>, and even <em>amputate</em>.

As explained by Dictionary.com, the word <em>impute</em> can be used to ascribe a characteristic to something: for example, "the gracefulness so often imputed to cats". It can also be used to identify the cause of something, or to place blame: he "imputed the rocket failure to a faulty gasket", for example.

The word also has a more specific meaning in a legal sense: "to ascribe to or charge (a person) with an act or quality because of the conduct of another over whom one has control or for whose acts or conduct one is responsible". The noun form <em>imputation</em> has specific meanings in economics, religion, and more; see its entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation" title="Imputation">Wikipedia</a> if you're curious.
