title: "Learn Teach Code: Documenting My Journey"
---

My main projects for 2017 all revolve around **<a href="http://learnteachcode.org/">Learn Teach Code</a>**, the meetup group I started in 2015. This is by far the most ambitious, scary, but also rewarding and fulfilling project I've ever worked on! So I figured I'd better share the journey. I want to openly share my own learning process and all the ups and downs along the way.

For **March 2017**, my newest (and craziest!) project is to start **my own programming bootcamp**, first with a four-week part-time pilot program that will most likely focus on providing an intro to full-stack JavaScript development. I have to learn a lot more myself before I can teach it, and I want to create a truly valuable experience for my future students! Meanwhile, I'm still struggling with my own personal challenges (specifically, anxiety and depression), so I want to share what happens, even if the whole thing ends up a spectacular failure.

**Here are all my blog posts and video blogs for this project so far:**
