title: "My 2016 Projects and Plans"
---

What do I want to do in 2016? I thought I'd collect all my notes in one place and organize them, and then I thought: why not make it public? A little accountability always helps! I'll be updating this page once a week.

## Big scary goals and guiding principles

- Make learning and teaching a regular part of my life.
- Main area of study for the year: math and computer science!
- By the end of the year, decide what career I'd like to pursue next. (Currently leaning towards software dev, as of 1/1/2016.)
- Continue to grow the [Learn to Code LA](http://learntocodela.org) community and turn it into a real nonprofit organization.
- Experiment with creative projects and documentation to share what I'm learning.
- Make two or three close friends.
- Reduce the frequency and severity of my anxiety.
- Do everything I can to prevent a relapse of depression.
- Decrease my reliance on my family for emotional support and take deliberate steps towards being more independent.

## January projects and events

Updated as of January 10th, 2016. (See changelog below for a record of all changes.)

- **DONE:** finished making [100 video blogs in 100 days](/vlog/), woohoo!
- Gradually transition to less frequent video blogs to share my learning process. *To decide:* do I want to put more time into each video, or spend less time overall on the videos?
- Start the [NAND2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/) course to learn how to build a computer from first principles.  
- January 4th and 18th: Teach two JavaScript workshops for Learn to Code LA and continue to find more volunteers and partners.
- **DONE:** January 8th: Give a talk at a local high school for girls interested in computer science.
- January 21st - 24th: Go to my very first tech conference, the [Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x)!

## Personal changelog

Extending the software development metaphor for cognitive behavioral therapy, I thought it would be fun to create an actual changelog for my self-improvement project! I will update this every week, with changes in reverse-chronological order:

#### Version 0.0.2, 2016 Week 2, January 10th

- **New rule:** instead of using words like "fix", "bug", "wrong", "fail" or "broken" when discussing my self-improvement project, I will only use positive or neutral words like "experiment", "observe", "accept" and improve". I don't *need* to change anything about myself; I just *want* to improve because I enjoy the process. **Self-acceptance means being able to say about *any* of my attributes, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"**
- **New rule:** plan to arrive 30 minutes early to any event that makes me nervous so I can meditate before leaving my car.
- **New habit:** morning routine now includes a walk to another location for my first work session.
- **Removed:** volunteer math tutoring commitment. (Focusing on computer science related volunteer work instead.)
- **Postponed:** side project idea to relearn sections of Rhapsody in Blue, documenting it and reviewing old video footage of my 2014 practice sessions.

#### Version 0.0.1, 2016 Week 1, January 3rd

- **Added:** This CHANGELOG (inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)), to track the project of reprogramming Liz's brain and to serve as a fun example of the confluence between software development (especially open source) and [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy). (Not sure how well I can follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), though.)
- **New rule:** schedule shared activities with my family prior to visiting them.
- **New rule:** schedule something fun or social for the day after my planned family visit.
- **New habit:** publish a daily blog post to share what I'm learning.
- **New habit:** weekly check-in and self-therapy vlog.
- **New habit:** morning routine: exercise, meditate, laugh, do a short personal check-in.
- **New guideline:** 36 hours of *focused* work per week: 15 hours studying computer science, 15 hours for video production, 6 hours for meetup group organizing.

#### Version 0.0.0, pre-existing architecture

- Practice piano 15 minutes a day. (As of 1/1/2014)
- Practice math problems for 15 minutes a day. (As of December, 2015)
- Evening routine: shower, stretches, read a book in bed.
- Commitment to be a volunteer math tutor for 2 hours per week. (As of December, 2015)
