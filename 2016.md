title: "My 2016 Projects and Plans"
---

What do I want to do in 2016? I thought I'd collect all my notes in one place and organize them, and then I thought: why not make it public? A little accountability always helps! I'll be updating this page periodically.

## Big scary goals and guiding principles

- Make learning and teaching a regular part of my life.
- Main area of study for the year: math and computer science!
- By the end of the year, decide what career I'd like to pursue next. (Currently leaning towards software dev, as of 1/1/2016.)
- Continue to grow the [Learn to Code LA](http://learntocodela.org) community and turn it into a real nonprofit organization.
- Experiment with creative projects and different methods of documentation to share what I'm learning.
- Make two or three close friends.
- Reduce the frequency and severity of my anxiety.
- Do everything I can to prevent a relapse of depression.
- Decrease my reliance on my family for emotional support and take deliberate steps towards being more independent.

## January projects and events

- Finish 100 days of [daily video blogs](/vlog/), then gradually transition to less frequent video blogs to share my learning process.
- Start the [NAND2Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/) course to learn how to build a computer from first principles.
- January 4th and 18th: Teach two JavaScript workshops for Learn to Code LA and continue to find more volunteers and partners.
- January 8th: Give a talk at a local high school for girls interested in computer science.
- January 21st - 24th: Go to [SCALE (Southern California Linux Expo)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x) for the first time!
- Start a weekly self-therapy video blog (since that's what many of the video blogs are anyway!) to review progress, practice some self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy to fight anxiety in a more structured way, and revise my goals regularly.
- Decide if I want to commit to teaching a math class at [The Midnight Mission](http://www.midnightmission.org/).
- Side project: relearning sections of Rhapsody in Blue, documenting it, and finally reviewing old video footage of my 2014 practice sessions.

## Daily habits

- Publish a daily blog post to share what I'm learning.
- Morning routine: exercise, meditate, laugh, do a short personal check-in.
- Practice piano 15 minutes a day (Started this habit on 1/1/2014)
- Practice math problems for 15 minutes a day (new habit!)
- Evening routine: shower, stretches, read a book in bed.

## Work schedule

This is just a general guideline to add some more structure to my day -- I may add more details later, but it will always be flexible. This first iteration (as of 1/1/2016) is based on my time-tracking data from December. Note: Tracked work hours only include really *focused* work, so they're nothing like my work hours back when I had an office job.

Work hours, initial target: 36 hours per week

- Computer science studying: 15 hours per week
- Video production (not including research/writing): 15 hours per week
- Learn to Code LA planning/prep: 6 hours per week

Other commitments:

- Learn to Code LA meetups: about 3 hours per week
- Math tutoring/teaching: 2 hours per week

Daily schedule outline (until Jan 8th, last daily video blog):

- Week days:
  - Video blog: 2 hours
  - Computer science study or other work: 4 hours
- Weekends:
  - Computer science study: 2 hours
  - Video blog: 1 hour
