<strong>ToDo Timer is a simple to-do list with a built-in timer and break reminders.</strong>

It keeps track of what you have to do and how long it takes, and it also reminds you when to take a break and when to get back to work.

<h2>Basic Version Features:</h2>

<ul>
<li>View and export timesheet data</li>
<li>Add/edit/delete items on the to-do list</li>
<li>Timer integrated with the to-do list</li>
<li>Landscape view has split-screen while timer is running</li>
<li>Reminder to take regular breaks with customizable alarm</li>
</ul>

ToDo Timer is based on the Pomodoro Technique for time management created by Francesco Cirillo.

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li>When marking a task complete, the work session timer will continue, keeping track of the time spent in between tasks. (I added this functionality specifically because I noticed I waste a lot of time stalling when switching tasks.)</li>
<li>Exported data is saved in CSV files, which can be opened by any spreadsheet program.</li>
<li>Android only allows emailing files after exporting them to the SD card. So to email the data, you'll need to have an SD card.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Features:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Categories for to-do list items</li>
<li>Sorting the to-do list by due date, category, or alphabetically</li>
<li>A viewable log of all completed tasks</li>
<li>Editing/deleting timesheet entries</li>
<li>...and more, depending on your suggestions!</li>
</ul>
